I had something of a digital detox this weekend as a friend visited from the UK. We spent the entire time outdoors, hiking and sightseeing, with hardly any screen time—aside from a quick look at some photos. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to share them here in this week's post.

I'll keep it short, as we're about to cook dinner, and let the images speak for themselves!

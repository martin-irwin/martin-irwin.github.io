These trees are so heavily pruned each year, I'm routinely amazed by their relentlessness. This particular tree stands about 10m tall, and is considerably old. There are two such trees, either side of the University of Tokyo's [Main Building](http://flic.kr/p/cWh4gW), pictured below (photo taken almost 1 year ago with my NEX-C3 & SEL16F28). The tree above is pictured in the far left of this image:

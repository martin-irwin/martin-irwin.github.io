Finally, we had an entire weekend of near-perfect weather. Each morning this week we left for work with sunglasses on, praying that the weather would hold for the weekend. We were in luck. We visited Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in the centre of Tokyo, cameras at the ready.

There were people picknicking and having lunch, but most people were walking around with either cameras or smartphones at the ready. We also took a lot of photos, but made an effort to appreciate the beautiful range of colours with our eyes and not vicariously through our LCD screens.

The maples are a huge attraction, turning from bright green to a vibrant red, via a visceral yellow.

But there were not just maples to behold...

I'm heading to Okinawa this morning, for some repair work this week. There's a chance I'll be able to catch the final stages of fall upon my return to Tokyo - but if not, I'll still be happy with this year's fall photos.

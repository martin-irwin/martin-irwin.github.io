_Feeding Koi │ NEX-7 & _Canon FD 50mm F1.4_ │ 50mm, _ISO 500, f/1.8, 1/60, 0EV__ We've been sold short this year. Last year, we were treated to at least one day off, every month, without fail. This year, I could count the days off on one hand. Here in Japan such days off are not "Bank Holidays" as in the UK, but special national holidays pertaining to some special event, on a fixed scale. Luckily, yesterday was "Health and Sports day", held annually on the second Monday in October. It commemorates the opening of the [1964 Summer Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Summer_Olympics "1964 Summer Olympics") being held in [Tokyo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo"), and exists to promote sports and an active lifestyle. I celebrated by sleeping in.

Today then, I was back to work. Within the work grounds is a beautiful pond, populated by wild Koi (Japanese carp) and turtles. When I went down to have a look, and clear my mind, I spotted this young lady there feeding the koi. Each of the koi are around 30cm to 50cm long, and occasionally leap out of the water to catch an unsuspecting insect.

_I do not own any test charts, and will be giving my subjective commentary on the usage of this lens, which I have owned and enjoyed using for over 3 years. This text and images below make up more of a "user report" than a strict review. Sit back with a beverage of your choosing and enjoy!_

## Build and Ergonomics

I believe this lens is becoming a sort of legendary lens. [According to popular lens testing website DxO](http://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sony-Zeiss-Sonnar-T-FE-55mm-f1.8-ZA-lens-review-Exemplary-performance), this is the highest resolving autofocus lens they've ever tested, and is only second in all-time lenses to the might Zeiss Otus 55mm f/1,4 (which costs over £3000 GBP at the time of writing). So, for around 1/4 of the price, this lens appears to deliver perhaps 95% of the quality, making it something of a bargain!

I rushed out to buy this lens upon release, as I knew it was going to be good from the original MTF charts. In fact, I made a point of the excellent transmittance values in my [A7(R) ramblings](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/reviews/2013/10/17/camera-musings-sony-a7r) (half-way down the page). Aside from the excellent transmittance, I knew the lens would have excellent Zeiss T\* coatings, to reduce flare and CA, and it's **weather-sealed**. This is a first for me. The only problem, is that did not have a weather-sealed camera... but it's easier to shield a camera body than its protruding lens. I don't plan on going snorkelling with this lens, but it's nice to know that if it starts drizzling, I can keep shooting.

As I've come to expect with Sony's E-mount offerings, this lens has fantastic build quality. By my touch, it's constructed to a higher level than previous E-mount lenses. The lens has a large rear element, as it's technically an FE lens, i.e. Full Frame E-mount. In short, this means that the lens creates an image circle larger than a 35mm "full frame" sensor. Until recently, E-mount cameras, i.e. the now-dead (by name only) NEX platform, "only" had APS-C sized sensors. I say "only", because the cameras are a marvel of engineering - they're so small and the sensor is rather huge. More on that in another article.

The metal outer casing feels premium in the hand, and the focus ring is perfectly dampened. A friend commented that it was _rather sublime_ - he mostly uses Leica rangefinder lenses for the [excellent photos on his site](http://ohm-image.net).

Why not 50mm? Well, as with any measurements, errors and uncertainties are involved. Lenses which are labelled as having a focal length of "50mm", will be probably be anywhere between 45 - 55mm (and thus the angle of view will be different). This lens is reported to be 55mm, and probably is very close - it is a precision instrument in every sense of the word.

## Bokeh

It's super sharp, but I will come to that next. The lens has excellent "sonnar" bokeh, due to the lens design, and its large f/1,8 aperture. I did wish for this lens to be f/1,4 at release, and now there is in fact an FE50F14Z, if you fancy spending a little more. They compared both lenses over at [DPreview](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/comparative-review-sony-fe-50mm-f1-4-za-vs-55mm-f1-8-za/2 "comparison") in far more depth than I ever could. I prefer the bokeh of the 55/1,8. I actually have a Canon nFD 50/1,4 kicking around somewhere that I can use if I really want f/1,4.

## Sharpness

I don't think there are any weaknesses on this lens. If your image isn't sharp, it's down to you. Or the camera. Which you are holding, so it's still you. I think the optics are nigh on perfect and ever at 36MP you have pixel-binned sharpness to die for.

## On APS-C

The NEX-7 sports a super-high resolution, 24MP APS-C sensor housed in a small, magnesium body. The Zeiss 55/1,8 seems like a natural partner for the metal NEX-7. The weight distribution is pretty good, though with the sizeable hood attached, you're definitely aware that you've got a lens attached to your thin camera. The "crop factor" results in a narrower field of view on APS-C (55 \* 1.5 = 82.5 mm) and the depth of field is more like f/2,7 in that respect. I have some images from a while ago, but I no longer have the NEX-7 and find the lens to be very natural on the A7R.

## On Full Frame

This lens was designed for use on a full frame camera and it does not disappoint. Whatever camera body you are using, if you are after a ~50mm focal length, I think this should be your lens. There's a 50/1,8 non-Zeiss lens that I may have purchased instead of this, but it wasn't available at the time. Would I trade now, and have a bit more cash? No way.

## Conclusions

The lens is basically perfect, offers a great field of view, great bokeh and unrivalled sharpness. It's light and well made. Really, it's one of my favourite lenses ever, and I have a bit of a think for manual focus lenses and vintage glass that exudes "charm". But really, if I want a snap like no other, if I want some "no hassle photography" then the 55/1,8 comes out with me and I never regret it.

Quite clearly Japan. The trees, the topography; this certainly isn't the UK. I don't usually take photos with multiple-exposure, as I don't usually take a tripod with me. The Zeiss performed well, and there is a huge amount of detail in the trees, and decent colour and micro-contrast. As always, taking the scene in, breathing the air, is much more impressive, but I hope this \[_heavily compressed_ JPEG\] gives you an idea.

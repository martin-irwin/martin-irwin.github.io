This apartment block, quintessentially Japanese in every way, had an interesting sign on the staircase: "No bicycles allowed". The tenants solved this by parking their bikes at the foot of the stairs. No rules broken. Phew! :)

At ISO 16,000 (!) many cameras this size (if they could shoot at ISO levels that high) would show nothing but a smudged mess. I'm continually impressed by this little RX1.

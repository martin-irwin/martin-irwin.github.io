There's a cyclic nature to the journey many people interested in photography will take, related to their gear. Artists with a vision, might be able to purchase a camera which realises their vision, and then go about producing images and art. Some photographers will manage this, but I think it's a small fraction, due to simple human nature.

The grass is always greener. Does a full frame camera take better pictures than an APS-C camera, or point and shoot with a 1" sensor? Not necessarily. The answer is both yes and no. In reality, it really depends on what the artist envisions. Cameras, and their lenses, are just tools.

It's easy to forget this simple fact, and get caught up in what is commonly termed "GAS" (gear acquisition syndrome). There's nothing wrong with it (if you have the space, and can afford it), but I implore you, dear reader, to think about the images you take, rather than the tool with which you take them.  

Try to avoid marketing hype, and get hold of something which lets you express yourself. If you purchase a new camera each year based on the idea that it will take better photos, you're looking from the wrong side of the image plane. Your washing machine does a good job getting clothes nice and clean, from which you make your brilliant, fashionable outfits, right? Cameras are the same. Recall that there were days before digital, and autofocus, and that great images were still made with inferior tools. And, they still are.

_Just in case the abstract image is too obtuse, this is an image of the inside of our washing machine. You know how you put an even number of socks into a washing machine, yet an odd number always come out? Well, I decided to investigate, and found said sock. I also liked what I saw from an aesthetic standpoint, and ran and got my camera, to Charlotte's surprise..._

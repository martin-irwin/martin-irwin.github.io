I've made a slight change to the way in which my "subscribe" emails are handled. Subscribers will now be greeted with an email containing the thumbnail picture (i.e. the picture that links to this post via the [blog](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog) link), and the post will contain an excerpt (hopefully encouraging recipients to pay my site a visit). You can subscribe to the mailing list at the bottom of my [contact page](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/contact/).

It’s been rather a busy end to the year, but that’s no surprise. The short daylight hours and other priorities have left photography as a distant thought in the back of my mind, as I keep my camera’s batteries charged, I am more focussed on (re)charging my own batteries rather than stressing about the website.

However, I would like to step up some of the wildlife and landscape photography in the near future. Once again, I ask myself if a new lens will re-ignite some of the fire in that regard.

I do see the benefits in something of a “travel zoom” which would allow me to go on a hike with just one lens as changing lenses when out and about is a bit of a hassle. I can see something 20-70 being useful… any thoughts? Naturally, I could of course just stick to 28/35mm and take photos and see how they go, as well as save my money. Thing is, I am starting to think I would appreciate autofocus more and more, especially in inclement or cold weather.

In other news, I have a new car (new to me). An Audi S6 Avant. And, it’s brilliant. I like it far more than I expected. I should review it – but I should really review my last car also, as that was rather special. In due time.

I am still taking lots of photos, mostly on the phone, but I plan on getting more use out of the cameras in the near future. Stay tuned.

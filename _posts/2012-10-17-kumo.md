_Kumo__│ NEX-7 & _Canon FD 50mm  F1.4_ │ 50mm, _ISO 400, f/8, 1/4000, 0EV____ Learning a language other than one's mother tongue is an undertaking I would recommend to all. After a certain point, not only is one able to converse with people from completely different cultures, upbringing and backgrounds, but one will also undergo a kind of self-reflection like no other. That is to say, I now study and understand and approach the _English_ language in a way I never did before. Learning English as a child, I've basically forgotten how I did so. Trial and error, sure, but I was also learning how to walk, read, count, ride a bike... etc. Learning a second language, as an adult, requires a different set of skills and a completely different approach to that of a child. I cannot learn Japanese simply by speaking it with my parents or class mates, as my parents don't know more than "konnichiwa", and I don't go to school. I need a much more structured and methodical approach, utilising my current skill set. Word association is one such technique.

For example, when I  started learning English, I knew no words at all, in _any_ language. However, I now have the English language at my disposal, and have images and metaphors in abundance, to associated imagery with the Chinese characters, or _Kanji_, in Japanese. Without the Kanji, spoken Japanese can be both ambiguous and down-right confusing.

Why the diatribe on the learning of Japanese? Well, it's because the words for "cloud" and "spider" have exactly the same sound in Japanese; _Kumo_. Kumo is cloud, and kumo is spider. "Oh, look at that huge kumo", someone shouts. Do they know I am a climate scientist... or are they warning me as a potential victim of arachnophobia? The message becomes clear with context, of course, but also when written. 雲 is cloud, and 蜘蛛 is spider. Completely different!

Well, the above image is of the former, and the lovely photo below is of the latter. I did it that way around so as to not scare anyone off!

A few weeks ago, I introduced a good friend and colleague of mine to Ale. I've heard people ask why British beer is "warm" many times in the past, and the simple reason is that there are two main types of "beer". Lager-beer is probably the most popular alcoholic beverage in the world (I'm not going to check). The Japanese have lager-beers \[Asahi, Kirin, Sapporo\], Americans have lager-beers (Budweiser, Muller-light, etc), and it all comes from the German "lager" which I believe means "storage". Lager is kept, and fermented, at low temperatures.

Ale, on the other hand, is made from malted barley and undergoes _warm_ fermentation. This is why British beer \[ale\] is warmer. It's not exactly what I would call warm, though. Sure it's not chilled to -2.4°C or anything, but temperatures in the UK are hardly ever more than a little mild.

Well, my Japanese friend really enjoyed the British Ales we drank, and spotted a Yokohama Ale whilst out and about in Yokohama (incidentally, my destination for tomorrow). He was kind enough to buy a bottle for me, which I enjoyed immensely, whilst watching the Detroit Red Wings win a fantastic hockey game.

Cheers, Ohata-kun!

It's essentially impossible to see the _Milky Way_ from Tokyo, due to the huge levels of light pollution.  Only when we venture far from our man-made distractions of flashing lights can we really appreciate how insignificant we are in the contexts of the universe.

This is a relatively recent dilemma. Years ago, before electricity, it would be common for people to look at the stars from their villages and towns, question the meaning of life (or perhaps simply pray to the current popular deity). These days, it's so rare to see the stars and the milky way, that I wonder if the number of people questioning the meaning of life, or their place in the universe is going up or down. On any given evening, it's hard to find someone not looking into their smartphone screen, rather than upwards into infinity.

> The title of this post _The River of Heaven_, was chosen from the direct translation from Japanese 天の川, and was brought to you on Autumnal Equinox Day (秋分の日 Shūbun no Hi); a public holiday in Japan that usually occurs on September 22 or 23.

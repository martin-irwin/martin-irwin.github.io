After a large typhoon [hit Tokyo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24531140) last night, the trains are uncharacteristically _not on schedule_. That usually means that trains are running, but they may be between 1-5 minutes behind their allotted time - but if you were to just stand on a platform you'd be waiting no more than 5 minutes at any rate.

I snapped this on the way into work this morning, as it's a rare sight indeed (usually this TV displays adverts or "everything is fine" messages. My camera is always with me in my bag, as it's so small. Its size and image quality were its main points of attraction. Today, Sony are expected to announce two new cameras - the A7 and A7r. They are 24 and 36MP full-frame _mirrorless_ cameras, with the interchangeableÂ Sony E-mount (the same mount used by the NEX series). The bodies are rumoured to cost around $2000, which is much less than say a full-frame Nikon D800/E. However, you'll need a lens to go with that shiny new camera, and the lenses are most likely going to cost north of $1000 a piece. I would love one of these new cameras, and the no doubt very nice lenses, but owning one is unlikely to improve my photography skills or output by any considerable margin. Furthermore, it's unlikely (to me) that the new cameras and 35mm lens will outperform the Sony RX1, which is a bespoke marriage of lens and sensor, in a near-pocketable body.

I'm not really in the market for a new camera, but I have always loved technology and the latest and greatest gadgets. My NEX-7 is essentially "as new", with no signs of wear and tear, and still gives me very pleasing results. Since owning the RX1, I have managed to avoid buying lens after lens for my NEX-7 and now have a good spread of high quality optics. The A7/r is something I would certainly consider in the future, depending on my needs at the time.

But for now, I've still got a lot to learn about photography, and I've just reached the point where I no-longer need to think about **how** to _operate_ the cameras and rather **what I want to get out of them**.

EDIT: I've since [expanded on](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/reviews/2013/10/17/camera-musings-sony-a7r) some of the thoughts shared in this post, in the "Reviews/Gear" section.

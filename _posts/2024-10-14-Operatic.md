Flying for 13 hours, sleeping for about 3, and landing at 6am are a recipe for a fading mind. Fortunately, the weather is fantastic here, and the temperature is perfect. It’s 25ºC outside and the bright sun is only a little warming, but lights up the streets so differently to the autumn light in Europe. Unfortunately, we had the genius idea of going to the opera on the day we landed, which means that the 1pm start feels more like a 2am start, but there we go.

We had the genius idea of going to the opera on the day we landed, which could have been a decent idea if we’d have slept more than a couple of hours in the last 48, but alas, we were serenaded by *[La Sonnambula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_sonnambula)* and essentially had to continually poke each other in the leg to wake log back on. The sleep depravation was so bad that the time between pinching each other and being woken up, the other was already asleep again. Quite comical. The performance itself was fantastic, and the crowd were often shouting “*Brava/Bravo*” following many a piece.

We made it back to the hotel at around 6pm, unpacked a little, and promptly passed-out. I woke up at 2am but managed to get back to sleep until around 5am, just in time for Tokyo’s characteristically-early sunrise.

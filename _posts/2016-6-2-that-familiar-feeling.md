Well, I'm back in Tokyo. My second home. I'm hoping to make it back here every year, as it's helpful to keep using Japanese. Also, I happen to love the place.

Here for 1 week on business, it took a little while to get over the jet lag, and also remember lots of the Japanese language I've forgotten over the last year.

But it did come back to me.

The smell of the air when alighting from the ANA Boeing 777, the sounds of the announcements all throughout Tokyo. The lack of long summer nights. It all came rushing back.

The first day back in Tokyo I was greeted by a pleasant 30°C late-Spring afternoon. The weather stayed above 25°C all week, with superb sunshine until the last day of the exhibition. I remembered how motivated I was to take pictures on a daily basis—interesting architecture and strong shadows. Plus, no house renovation to soak up my time!

However, even with only two "free" days in Tokyo this time, I still managed to take a fair few photos, which I'll share with you here in due course. I hope you like them :)

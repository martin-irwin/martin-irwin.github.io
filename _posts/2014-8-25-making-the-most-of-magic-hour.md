It's nice to still have oodles of daylight available after a [full day out](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2014/8/24/waddesdon-manor). Better still, the sun hangs low in the sky, which results in some nice shadows and interesting lighting.

This weekend is a "bank holiday" weekend in the UK. A bank holiday is a public holiday with no automatic right to time off, although banks close and the majority of the working population is granted time off work or extra pay for working on these days, depending on their contract. There are considerably fewer public holidays in the UK than Japan, but in the UK it is customary for most employees to use their entitled holiday, whereas in Japan many people simply give up their entitlement. The end result, is that people in the UK definitely have more time off, on average, than those working in Japan. I can't say that I miss that aspect of Japanese culture.

On the flip side, most shops are shut over the bank holiday. Sunday trading hours in the UK are typically 10am–4pm or thereabouts, whereas in Japan, Sunday is just another day (as it should be). I certainly do miss being able to do some shopping (even if just groceries) after 4pm on a Sunday. Here, we're having to do the food shopping first, and then do whatever for the rest of the day. No wonder the economy isn't recovering very quickly—who can go shopping Monday to Friday 9am–5pm? I'm in the office, so not me.

As is customary in the UK, on the late summer bank holiday, it's raining! In fairness, until last night the weather's been rather nice indeed. A little bit chilly, but compared to the high humidity and 35ºC+ temperatures in Tokyo, very comfortable. It's very easy to think that the _grass is greener_, but in reality, it's simply different _shades_ of green.

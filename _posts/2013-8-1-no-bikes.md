This apartment block, quintessentially Japanese in every way, had an interesting sign on the staircaseNo bicycles allowed". The tenants solved this by parking their bikes at the foot of the stairs. No rules broken. Phew! :)

At ISO 16,000 (!) many cameras this size (if they could shoot at ISO levels that high) would show nothing but a smudged mess. I'm continually impressed by this little RX1.

I’ll potentially write a little more about this in a separate blog series. It’s nothing to do with photography, but the blog isn’t simply photography, it’s my blog. The weather’s been over 30ºC all week, and I’ve basically tried to avoid melting all week, whilst having a very busy week making corporate presentations and so on. So, the camera didn’t get much use. In the evenings, I often unwind with some video games.

The above image shows my SEGA Astro City arcade cabinet from Japan (left), a MiSTer FPGA with supergun controller running on both an LCD and B&O CRT simultaneously.

Perhaps most of these words are completely bewildering to my readers, perhaps not! Either way, every aspect in this photo needs some in-depth and proper explanation, but the weather is a much cooler 29ºC, so I am going to get away from computer screens for a few hours, sit on the balcony with a book, and make the most of my Sunday.

To tide you over until next week, here’s a phone snap from an after-work motorbike run.

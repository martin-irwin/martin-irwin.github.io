The weather forecast for Sunday wasn't good, so we hopped into the car and hit the road. We don't really know the area well at all, such is the life of a commuter in the UK. After driving around a little, we parked the car, and continued on foot.

The skies were quite clear, but there was a biting wind. We headed for a peak, where we'd seen some sheep... but by they saw us coming, and we were only presented with their bottoms. I thought better of taking a photo, so you are spared.

The light fades very quickly this time of year, with little sunlight throughout the day. In strong contrast to Tokyo this time of year, barely a day goers by without rain. It's sometimes difficult to find the motivation to embrace the cold wind on a clear day, but the optical clarity to be had makes it worthwhile.

That, and appreciating a nice hot drink inside, even more.

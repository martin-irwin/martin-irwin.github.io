It's slowly getting warmer. The days are getting longer. The sun was out, and so at lunchtime a visit to the Cambridge Botanical Gardens was in order ([again](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2015/2/10/cambridge-botanical-gardens)), and see how things have changed. I imagine visiting the CBG will become something of a common activity. There are many flowers and trees, and it's generally a very nice place to walk around during lunchtime.

What I like most about the botanical gardens is the wide variety of flora within its [16 hectare area](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Cambridge+University+Botanic+Garden/@52.194284,0.126093,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xeddc913f0dc06549).

After what feels like an eternity of cloudy and rainy weather (though we've admittedly had the odd dry spell), it was lovely to spend some time in an environment appearing more and more lush and vibrant by the day.

There's a striking building within the grounds; housing a café and the botanical research facility. I've not yet been to the café, but will definitely do so at some point. For coffee and cake, most likely.

I was also lucky enough to stumble across an old friend, _bamboo (though nothing like the [vast forests of the stuff in Japan](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/7/22/cant-see-the-wood-for-the-trees))._

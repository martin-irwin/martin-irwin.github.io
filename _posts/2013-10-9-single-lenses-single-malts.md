I met up with a fellow RX1 owner and photography-enthusiast last night, for a bite to eat and a few drinks. He brought along his Ricoh GR, and I was quite impressed by it. The build is good, and the firmware really is as good as it's hyped up to be. With all the recent rumours and excitement over the "full-frame" NEX... I do wonder if people have chosen to forget the NEX firmware. Personally, I don't mind it (the NEX-7 has enough hardware controls), but I don't think I've heard one good thing about it. I wonder if firmware is going to be the main complaint of the FF-NEX - or maybe magenta casting when using Leica-M mount lenses below 35mm. Either way, short of very expensive Leica glass, I don't see the FF-NEX beating the output of the RX1 at 35mm - at other focal lengths there is no competition, of course ;)

The above photo is testament to the lens & sensor combination on the RX1. At ISO 12800, the fine print on the bottles is still clearly legible, which is more than could be said for my own vision at the time....

Note the amazing spherical ice (it was very difficult not to refer to it as an ice _cube_).

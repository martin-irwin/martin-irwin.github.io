Quite a few people showed interest in my "[University Potato](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/11/5/university-potato-daigaku-imo-)" post, and I agreed that perhaps I didn't give this rather interesting and utterly delicious snack its proper [15 minutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame). So here we go. We went back... 

We ventured back to _Ueno-okachimachi_ in the northeastern quarter of Tokyo, so I could take a few photos, and we could scoff a few potatoes. The proprietor was waiting behind the counter, in the usual unassuming manner associated with Japanese shop-keepers. When I snapped this photo, I believe he supposed that I may have just been taking photos of the area. His face lit up when we made a bee line for the shop entrance.

The top-photo shows the main two types of 大学芋 (daigaku imo) on sale. _Komachi_ and _kamote._ Upon entering the shop, I conversed with the shopkeeper and enquired what the difference was between _komachi_ and _kamote_. To our surprise, he tried to answer us in English! The gist of it was, that _komachi_ was a little drier, a little more fluffy, and _kamote_ are more dense and juicy. He also explained a little in Japanese, and then rushed over to grab two wooden forks... so we could taste the difference!

500g of your finest _kamote_ please! 

(▰˘◡˘▰)   (｡´∀｀)ﾉ

500g wasn't enough for him; he added two extra chunks! After handing just a few hundred yen in exchange for a half-kilo of carb-goodness, he then said "ahh, service! service!", and quickly picked up his tongs. **Top tip:** If you're in a Japanese restaurant, or food establishment and hear the word "service", it means _for_ _free_. He quickly filled another bag with 200g worth of _komachi!_ We couldn't believe it! We won't be needing dinner tonight...

By this point, there's not much left to say. We sustained a huge sugar-high, which lasted until bedtime! If you're in Japan in autumn, be sure to track down some _daigaku-imo_!

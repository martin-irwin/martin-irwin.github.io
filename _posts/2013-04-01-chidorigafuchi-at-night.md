Just as fast as it came... it's gone. Tokyo's hanami, lasting just about 10 days, surprised us all and has left as suddenly as it came. It's all pretty much green now. However, one evening last week, we took a stroll beside the [Chidorigafuchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidorigafuchi_National_Cemetery) (easy for me to say) National Cemetery, close to the infamous [Yasukuni shrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasukuni_Shrine), where the sakura are lit up at night. Hundreds of people are out, quietly drinking a beer (or two), eating snacks, and generally having a great time (taking their rubbish home, naturally). I struggled to take a decent photo, I just wasn't in the mood. It was much nicer to simply hold hands and walk underneath the blossom on a warm spring evening.

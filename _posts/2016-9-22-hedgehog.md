Finally, I used my camera again! In fairness, I have been using my camera on-and-off all summer, but either haven't had the time to publish things to the web (not ideal, but I do still want to keep the site going, as it does motivate me somewhat), or post-process. I can see why mobile photography is only going to get more and more popular as time goes on. The instant gratification is appealing. Upload and share photos within moments, never having to worry about formatting etc etc.

I'm one step closer in that I can actually completely write and edit blog posts on my phone now, but if I want to take photos on my camera, there's still another hoop through which to jump. It's not a big deal. Every time I take a photo with my camera I am glad I have it, and wish I took more photos, of more interesting subject matter, more interesting places. Then life gets in the way, and whether I am working or doing DIY, photography falls to the bottom of the to-do list. I have kept promising DIY progress reports, but there's just some finishing touches to make to the bathroom before it's ready to photograph. It's annoyingly close, though, so I need to just step up and do it.

Anyway, last night I went outside to get something from the car and noticed a big ball of shadow on the shingle driveway. I guessed it was a hedgehog, and went inside to get my camera. Once I'd chosen a decent lens (needed to have f/2 or faster), I went outside to photograph my new friend. But he'd gone! I had a look around, and then thought; "where would I hide if I were a hedgehog"—yes, under my car!

Showers are the theme for June. Rain showers, and bathroom showers. It's almost constantly raining at the moment, and is predicted to continue raining for as long as weather forecasts dare... erm, forecast. The rain's fine, really. I am from the UK, after all. I lived in Manchester for 7 years, which is [famous](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/2938204.stm) for its near-constant rain. It's the elevated temperatures and humidity that are the killer in Japan during _tsuyu_, the rainy season.

You wake up, sticky. You shower. Within 5 minutes of leaving an air-conditioned room, you want a shower. You arrive at work, feeling as if you've jogged the entire way wearing a polyester _[shell suit](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=shell+suit&bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&bvm=bv.47883778,d.dGI&biw=1436&bih=783&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=qNa5UbT3OMfjkAWfmoHQAw)_. You go through the entire day wishing you were in a desert, or some kind of arid landscape. Occasionally you think back 6 months, when you were wearing moisturiser due to the severe dryness, a scarf, a duffel coat, and shivering in the street. Rushing into the relative warmth of the trains with their heated seats. How on earth can this be the same place?

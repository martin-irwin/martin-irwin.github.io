Woke up just before 6am this morning, to help Charlotte get the express train to the airport from the other side of Tokyo. Tokyo's Narita Airport is quite far from the centre of Tokyo - be warned! Don't get a taxi there. I've heard some horror stories. Anyway, up early, carrying bags, so I wanted a light camera with me. I took the NEX-7, which is pretty light, mated to the excellent Sigma 30mm F2.8, which I haven't used a lot recently due to the possession of the exquisite Zeiss 24mm. The Sigma is smaller, and lighter, so it was my choice for this morning.

The crop above is just about only the top half of the original image. The sharpness really impresses me with this lens! This morning, the weather was completely overcast, but the sun is still strong and manages to turn everything into a very hazy yellow hue. The sky is all but obliterated, but there wasn't anything really to see anyway; it's mostly just scattered light bouncing around the cloud cover.

I walked from Nippori Station, to the University, choosing back allies rather than the suggested fastest route (right). I am usually first into the office anyway, but there was little chance of anyone beating me this morning! 

The empty streets give a serenity often missing from daily Tokyo life, with its general hustle-bustle, cramped streets, rooms, and trains. The odd _salaryman_ (Japanese for a generic business man) would walk past,  and a few shop keepers were cleaning their store-fronts, or putting out produce. There was the odd shout of _"Irasshai!"_  ("Welcome!"), and the odd squark of a crow.

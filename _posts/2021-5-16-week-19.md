It’s definitely feeling like Spring now, though it’s been a slow start. There are still traces of snow on the highest peaks of the Black Forest, but there’s a bit of warm in the sun. It’s been raining on and off, and the alternation feels very spring-worthy.

We had snow yesterday, but I am not sure it reached the ground. Some days are warmer, there’s a cold wind, and a lot of rain.

I haven’t minded the weather, as I’ve been busy with an indoor project and will collate it together a bit and get some photos/write up on here soon.

Old shrine near Kabira Bay, where you can take a glass-bottomed boat and see giant clams, sea turtles, clown fish, and much more!

The snorkelling at Yonehara is exceptional. The beach quickly descends into an extensive coral reef, which extends to over 100m out from the shore, where it quickly drops from depth of 2m to some 20m or more (a dark abyss). This means you can dive down to this “cliff” and look up, back to the reef and see all the fish and corals lit up by the sun above. Unfortunately I don’t have an underwater camera, but perhaps next time…

The islands in this part of the world are incredibly special, and I hope that they can be kept to a good level of natural habitat and cleanliness for years and decades to come.

What's that smell? Oh, it's _kinmokusei,_ otherwise known as "G_olden Sweet Osmanthus"_ (also called the _sweet olive_)_._ This shrub is found all throughout Japan, and blossoms in Autumn, giving off a very sweet and pleasing aroma.

Charlotte was the first (between us) to notice this smell, and track down the source. At first I thought it was because she was lower to the ground than I, but the bushes grow to over 5m tall, so she simply has a keener sense of smell!

The smell really is sweet. Sweet as in _sweets_.  The abundance throughout Japan has made this time of year probably the best _smelling_ in all of Japan's seasons. We've decided that when we have a garden once again, to plant some of these close to a window.

The Chinese character for _kinmokusei_ are: golden 「金」; tree「木」and rhinoceros 「犀」... yeah, I wasn't expecting that either. Tree and rhinoceros together produce the word meaning _osmanthus_, 木犀, but I have no idea why - I'll try to find out the meaning, as I love the mystery behind the characters. 

Unfortunately, the [typhoon this week](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/10/16/not-on-schedule) blew all of the golden flowers away. I'll miss these sweet olive trees, but probably not as much as Charlotte.

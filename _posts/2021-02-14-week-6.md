The problem with designing a theme is that if you want to change it, you’re either stuck with a step change in design, or you go-back and redo everything. I suppose the alternative to those two options is to wish you had a different design, and hope the resentment doesn’t build up too quickly.

In this instance, I actually speak of the “WEEK #” thumbnails for each blog post in this series. In a while the numbers are going to get very long—“twenty three”, for example—and then I’ll have a design conundrum. It doesn’t really matter, and perhaps I will change it up, though I do like the consistency I’ve managed thus far.

The week was characterised by sub-zero temperatures (even at the hottest part of the day), and some very dry snow which has settled and been a lovely winter view.

I was encouraged by Danielle to take a walk at lunchtime the other day, and it was nice to have some fresh air and have snow crunching under my feet. My car’s battery is in the basement, being recharged, and I haven’t bothered putting on my winter wheels as I am not driving anywhere.

For the last 4 months my main exercise has consisted of only my indoor rowing machine, almost religiously after work on weekdays. I am actually fitter than I was this time last year! I’ve no idea how much I weigh (well, I have an idea), but I am not as strong as when I used to lift weights. The rowing machine is a great body workout and gets some muscle work done as well as cardio. Anyway, this preamble is because I went for my first row yesterday since October 2020. I was invited to join a fellow Master in the 2x (double scull). Even though it was -5ºC, in the sun it felt “warm” and exercise keeps you warm anyway. Well, it does, if you don’t have ice-cold 50cm tall waves smashing into your back! It was a row that was certainly OAR inspiring (I never apologise for puns). The Rhein has quite a mass flow of water, and if the wind opposes this flow… physics happens. The boat’s riggers and the oar were actually covered in ice when we finally made it back, and we had around 30L of water (30 kgs remember!) of additional payload. I couldn’t feel my toes or fingers, but on our way back, when I was imagining being in a warm bed, or sauna, or on a beach, I realised that I was feeling _very alive_. For the last … year?… I have been inside this apartment almost exclusively, and the rowing club was my highlight of 2020. To me, it is extremely obvious how good sport is for my physical **_and_** mental health.

I can’s remember the last time I shivered like that—30 minutes after leaving the club I was in a nice hot bath (thank you, Danielle), slowly elevating my core temperature. But, it was worth it. Not quite the same workout as on my rowing machine, which is a linear drive mechanism. The boat, rocking in this mini-ocean of the Rhein yesterday, requires very separate muscle groups around your hips and your core, as well as shoulders to keep hold the blades out. However, I did notice that I wasn’t out of breath in the same way I was last year.

I’m hoping for some rowing events and races this year. There was a race cancelled in November, for which our 8 was training. Until I was freezing my ass off in the boat I didn’t realise quite how much I’ve missed it.

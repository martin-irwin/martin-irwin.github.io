We've lived here, in Setagaya ward's _Sakurajosui_, for over three years now. And for a few weeks each year, its name's been very apt. As predicted, Sunday was a wash-out. Huge amounts of rain, and howling winds kept us to the confines of our apartment. For a couple of days now, I've been nursing a heavy cold, but took my camera with my when I went to get some fresh air, and replenish supplies.

_Sakurajosui_, written 桜上水 - and yes, I can write that by hand ✌(◕‿-)✌  \- literally means _cherry-blossoms above water_.

As I walked to the shops, I would pass over blossom-embossed manhole covers, with the draining water from the weekend still clearly audible. 

The blossoms are simply everywhere. In winter, one never notices _sakura_, as they're just dark, bare trees. Likewise, in the summer, they're just a huge mass of green. There are hundreds planted around Tokyo, and viewing them in peace and quiet makes a nice change to the _tour de force_ that is Japanese hanami (flower viewing) in the larger parks.

This set of shots was taken whilst wandering around the residential backstreets close to our apartment, on my way to the shops.

For Part 1, my weapon of choice was the Sony A7r, mounted with the Voigtländer Nokton Classic 35mm F1.4.

I'm somewhat familiar with the 35mm focal length, due in part to using an [RX1](http://http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/reviews/2014/3/29/rx1-review) as my main camera for a considerable time. I have found the 35mm focal length to be something of a natural fit for me. It allows enough width, yet details are only a step or two away. I've still got a lot to learn, though.

_In Part 2, I'll present images from the A7R with a slightly narrower field of view..._

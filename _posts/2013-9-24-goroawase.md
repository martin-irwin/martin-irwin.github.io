Tokyo Sky Tree towers above Tokyo at a height of 634m, broadcasting HD television (amongst its other uses). Its height of **634m** was no accident; it stands in the old province of _Musashi_ and the numbers **6** (mu) **3** (sa) **4** (shi) spell out _mu-sa-shi_.

Using numbers to spell out words in this manner is called _Goroawase_ in Japanese, and is extremely popular. In another example, the number 23 can be read as "ni san", and the car manufacturer Nissan frequently enter cars numbered '23' into motorsport events.

As you can see from the first photo, space is at such a premium in Tokyo that the most likely place to find a garden, is on a rooftop!

_Waffles | NEX-7 & SEL24F18Z | 24mm, 1/125s, f/2.2, ISO100 , RAW_ Not exactly the most healthy of afternoon snacks, but perhaps one of the most tasty! This cute little waffle-shop in _shimokitazawa_ specialises in waffles and coffee... so that's what we had! I went for the healthy option of strawberries and custard, topped with oodles of maple syrup, and a strong black coffee with which to wash it down. Lovely!

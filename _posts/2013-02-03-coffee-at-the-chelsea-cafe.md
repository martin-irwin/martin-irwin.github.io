Just got back from a 4k run (starting small) with Charlie, as we've been feeling a little lazy over the past... two years. Gym memberships are very expensive in Tokyo, and another main issue is a complete lack of time. Anyway, we thought we'd have a late lunch so that we didn't need much to eat tonight after our run.

We both opted for the House Club Sandwich at the Chelsea Café in the centre of Shinjuku. I had a black coffee, which could be refilled for a small charge, and Charlie went for the Royal Milk Tea. Honestly, sometimes, we forget we are thousands of miles from the UK.

Here's one nice thing about driving into work, rather than taking a cramped commuter train in Tokyoâ€”the view.

It's rather beautiful most mornings. The sun gently rises above the trees, bathing the fields in very warm light, which lifts the morning dew from the fields, grass, and trees. It's easy to ignore this natural splendour for a couple of reasons: 1) being, and remaining, in control of a motor vehicle, and 2) it's easy to take the things you do each day for granted. Only one of these is in our control until fully automated cars are a \[grim\] reality, and it's something I made a conscious effort to avoid in Tokyo.

Taking the same route each day is nothing more than an opportunity to see something new, to spot the differences. It's all too easy to get into a daily grind, and not really realise how you arrived at your destination. It takes another level of effort to avoid monotony, and I'd say it's worth it.

It's also worth slinging your camera in your car; you never know when you'll be at a level crossing!

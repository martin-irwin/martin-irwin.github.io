title: July 2025
excerpt: Escaping some of the heat that kicked off July 2025 with photos from a recent hike up Mt. Rigi. Time may feel steady rather than fleeting, but life is full of movement—more hiking than ever, and steady progress learning kanji. Enjoy these snapshots from the trail and a brief update on what’s been keeping me busy.

No matter what, the weeks roll by. Here we are in July 2025, apparently. I do not really have a feeling that time is flying, though, which is nice. Rather, lots has been happening, and continues to happen. 

- we are hiking more than ever, and will indeed hike Mt Rigi tomorrow
- I have now learnt 1620 kanji (chinese characters) and have the aim of completeing the course of 2300 before the end of August. A tall but realistic challenge, that requires daily study and dedication. Read more about that journey, [here](/japanese).
- changes on the work front - more on that another time perhaps

I am making use of the Adobe Lightroom package for my iPad and Mac Mini, but I am considering getting rid of the iPad and either getting a MacBook Air M4 or just sitting it out. The iPad does do a great job, but the Adobe subscription is pretty expensive.

I'll throw in some photos from the last hike, up Mt. Rigi a couple of weeks ago. I didn't get around to publishing a post, but finally, here we are.

Enjoy the photos, and see you soon.

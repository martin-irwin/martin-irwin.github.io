Fashions come and go, but the suit is essentially the epitome of timeless style. Mens clothing had been working towards the "lounge suit" slowly over the centuries, culminating with the quintessentially perfectly proportioned suit of the 1920s. Everything since then has simply been minor tweaks, which often date the suit easily, and badly. 50s baggy suits, 60s skinny lapels, 70s wide lapels and bell bottoms, 80s power shoulders, 90s three buttons and shiny fabrics, 2000s too short, and 2010s too short _and_ too tight.

Due to the globalisation of the world, and product streams, most suits will experience thousands of miles of travel between sheep and store interior. The famous Savile Row is fighting against department stores and other brands misusing the word "bespoke" (from "to **be spoke**n for"), which means to make an entire suit from scratch for a customer. Made To Measure (MTM) is a halfway house between off the rack (OTR) and bespoke. There's merits to each technique.

The primary concern with a suit is its fit. Then fabric. Always in that order. There's nothing wrong with buying a well fitting suit off the rack. You can always have adjustments made. If you have a bad tailor make you a suit, it will look bad no matter the fabric.

Savile Row prides itself on good tailors.

There's something very quaint about Savile Row, with the shop floors showing examples of excellent suiting, above the basements where the garments are created. Times have changed—hardly anyone wears a suit in the UK now when compared to the men of 1916—but some traditions remain.

Only the man in bronze is suited and booted.

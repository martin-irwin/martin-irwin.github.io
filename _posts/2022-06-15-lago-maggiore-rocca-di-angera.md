It’s been quite a while since my last post, but that’s for a few reasons. Firstly, I have a new job, starting in September, about which I am extremely excited. More news on that nearer the time, dear reader. Secondly, unlike 2020 and 2021, I’ve been out and about almost non-stop. That includes international travel! I’ve visited the UK four times already this year (after not seeing my brother and his family for 2 years), and will indeed be there again next week, and we’re only half way through 2022. Thirdly, I’ve been so busy with a host of other activities, that sitting down at the computer to write a post or even download photos from the camera has been a real challenge. But, here we are.

I was fortunate to visit Italy on business last week, and took a few photos of the local scenery during my travels. I’d never been to Lago Maggiore before, and wasn’t there for long, but will definitely visit again. There are some rather specials islands that we must visit… but didn’t on this trip.

Instead, on this trip, we visited Rocca di Angera;

> also called Borromeo Castle, is a castle on a lakeside hilltop in the limits of the town of Angera in the Province of Varese on the Southern shores of Lago Maggiore. It is visible from across the lake from Arona, where originally stood another castle formerly owned by the Borromeo family

The weather was around 27ºC but extremely humid, with a torrential thunderstorm during our visit.

The castle gardens are absolutely wonderful, and one could easily spend a whole day up here.

In other news, we discovered a new favourite coffee drink “shakerato” which is expresso shaken (not stirred) with ice, and served typically in a martini glass (but not here). It’s delicious and is a firm favourite.

Following our stay here, we ventured down on the train to Milano for a short visit. More to follow in the next post!

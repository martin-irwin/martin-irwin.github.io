Walking away from the house, we ventured down one of the many available paths. The grounds surrounding the house are almost entirely woodland, and were not busy at all.

We headed to the "Bridge Water" monument, which is the starting point for many of the walks throughout the vast estate. I'm \[not really\] surprised that in 2015, the walk isn't just a list of GPS Google Map waypoints which can be downloaded, but rather a [list of instructions and a tiny map](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/article-1355794809383/). 

There were a lot more people over here, at the "official" starting point for walks, so it was quite noisy—no chance of seeing deer anywhere close to the monument, I'd wager!

Autumn is one of my favourite seasons for colour, and the long shadows produced day-long by the low-hanging sun.

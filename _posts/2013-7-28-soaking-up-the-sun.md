Yesterday saw the \[temporary\] return of fair weather after a week of drizzle. The temperature was around 35°C again, and the flowers seemed to appreciate the strong sunlight, after all that juicy rain.

We ventured out of central Tokyo, as Charlotte has a field campaign on the outskirts. After checking the instruments, we walked back though the \[relative\] countryside to the train station. On the bus ride to the site, I remembered seeing this sunflower farm, and just had to grab a few snaps.

I'd never properly looked at the inside of a sunflower before now. It's quite mesmerising!

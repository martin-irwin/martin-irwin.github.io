A small update to start the weekend. 

I have added a new page (not yet indexed) on the site called "**Japanese**". You can go ([take a look](https://www.martinirwinphotography.com/japanese/)) at it and see what I'm up to. In short, I am documenting my Japanese reading learning abilities over the next months. I'm using an app called **Anki** ([AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/)), which is Japanese for "memorisation". I originally used this in 2006 or 2007, when it was first created... then I basically forgot about it and stopped using it. However, for the last months, I use it daily to learn Japanese "**kanji**" (the Chinese characters) that I do not know. I only knew 50-100... and at the time of writing I have surpassed 1000 studied. I have a goal of just over 2000, which will make reading Japanese far easier that it is for me at present. 

That's essentially it, right now. There are a few other things barely worth mentioning, such as the new **V90 SD card** I bought for my camera which is significantly faster at saving files and transferring them than my old SD card. It's always interesting to me when form factors remain the same and performance gains are all "under the hood".

I had a couple of comments that my last B&W shot was appreciated, so here's another. 

Have a great weekend!

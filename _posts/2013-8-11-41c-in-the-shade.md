Tokyo reached 41°C today. 41°C _in the shade_, is arguably not something any sane person wants to tolerate for too long. The heat was so intense that cracks began to appear in the sky. A huge thunderstorm, like nothing I've seen before, passed directly overhead.

The apartment building next to us was struck, apartments opposite faced a similar fate (pictured above). Somewhere, _Keio_ train line (our local) was struck, denying our escape. Trains are rarely late in Japan, but the entire line was suspended for safety checks following the strike.

We didn't complain.

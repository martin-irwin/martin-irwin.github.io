## Kamakura Pt. 1 - Hokokuji

Affectionately called "Little Kyoto", the city of Kamakura in eastern Japan is a popular tourist destination. Little over an hour from central Tokyo, it's home to numerous temples and a distinctly Japanese feel. I've been to Kamakura a few times before (this was my brother's first time), but this time it was a little different - we rented bicycles!

_Hokokuji_ dates back to 1334, and was a place to house family treasures and pay homage to the grandfather of the first Ashikaga Shogun. A small entrance fee of ¥200 helps keep this stunning forest meticulously maintained.

The dense canopy above provided us with much needed shelter from the strong afternoon sun above.

_Hokokuji_ is a 45 minute walk from the train station, but with bicycles, it only took us around 5 minutes. It's a great way to get around Kamakura. Stay tuned for more!

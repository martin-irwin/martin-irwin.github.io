We've had a very uncharacteristic haze the last couple of days; with visibility lower than I've ever witnessed in Tokyo - _even_ **_Beijing_** was cleaner! Contrary to what many may think, this is just Tokyo sitting in its own filth, due to a lack of wind; high pressure, and a peak temperature of 17ºC.

Today was much colder. So cold, in fact, that it snowed! The first snow of 2014 in Tokyo. It's since stopped (by around 8pm), and the sky is completely clear, with a beautiful moon. There's no haze now the particles have been washed out. It's currently -2ºC outside (and barely warmer inside)... Winter's reminded us it's still here.

The weather in Tokyo has taken a sharp turn and become rather cold. Just two weeks ago, I didn't need a jacket, but now there's a crispness in the air signifying the upcoming winter.  

The shot above really couldn't be from anywhere other than Japan, in my book. I took this photograph yesterday afternoon at dusk, utilising the Voigtländer's wide aperture, aka "fastness", to absorb as much light as possible. I was very pleased with the result, as I have probably missed the peak of Autumn this year, but managed to get at least one shot showing the contrasts and colours one can expect in Japan during this dynamic month.

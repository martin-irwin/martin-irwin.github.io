Another week, another shot from my apartment window. This time, we have yet another rainbow (are you bored yet?), but during a snow-storm.

It’s turned bloody cold again, and there’s a decent sprinkling atop the beautiful mountains of the black forest.

I keep wanting to take photos of something different, but the truth is it’s too cold to want to go for a walk most of the time, and I am busy with work, and indoor projects. I think as spring emerges I’ll have some more variety on these weekly posts, but I hope you enjoy them nevertheless.

These fascinating structures are dotted all around [_Fukui_](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/?tag=fukui), holding back the rocks. I estimate the size of each grid to be around 50cm squared. To be honest, they're rather unsightly. The natural folds in the mountainside are broken up by these structures, but they make for an interesting composition.

I suppose that's what you get for living in the ring of fire... that, and Japan _loves_ concrete!

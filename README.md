# Welcome to Kuroshi
### Tech, photos, and ramblings.

This is the source code for [kuroshi.net](https://kuroshi.net). 

## 📐 The Philosophy: "Clinical Minimalism"
After moving away from heavy Jekyll themes (Minimal Mistakes), this site was rebuilt from the ground up to be a high-performance, distraction-free digital garden. 

I also removed my long-ass url name and have something more sleek.

* **Standalone Architecture**: No remote themes or external dependencies.
* **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with a custom "Pure" layout focusing on typography and imagery.
* **Clinical Design**: Monospace fonts, high contrast, and zero fluff.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Engine**: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 3.10.x
* **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (Custom Workflow)
* **Search**: Client-side indexing via Lunr.js
* **Styling**: Compressed Sass with a "Less is More" approach

I am currently typing this on my Sony VAIO P which is to be my main website editing tool for 2026 and beyond.

## 🚀 Local Development
To run this site locally for testing:
1. Ensure you have Ruby and Bundler installed.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve

_A Winter Sunset │ NEX-7 & SEL16F28 & UWA │ 12mm, ISO 500, f/22, 1/60, RAW_

A beautiful and warming sunset shone through the corridors this afternoon, so I grabbed the camera and stuck it out of the window. The University of Tokyo has a very distinctive main building, which has featured in a few of my blog posts (mainly on my [tumblr](http://martindesu.tumblr.com "my tumblr")).

It doesn't look it, but it was zero most of the day today, with a high of 3°C. The snow from 12 days ago can still be found in little piles here and there. Winter's not over yet!

There's no mistaking summer in Japan. Any summertime _anime_ scene will have their distinct chorus in the background. I say background, but sometimes it can feel as if you're wearing these things as headphones. They certainly have an awesome song.  

The thing is, I miss them when they're gone. I look forward to their calls all year, as they signify that summer is _really here_.  It's also a noise not familiar to the UK, so I only associate it with Japan. Cicadas in different countries seem to have a different pitch. Apparently it's only the males which call, but I've not looked close enough to check. 

_We go on our summer holiday today, so I'm not sure when I'll next make a new post._

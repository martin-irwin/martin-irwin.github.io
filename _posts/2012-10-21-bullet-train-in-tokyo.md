_Bullet-train in Tokyo │_ __NEX-C3 & _SEL 16mm  F2.8_ │ 16mm, _ISO 640, f/7.1, 1/60, 0EV___ Tokyo is so densely populated not just by people, but the buildings and communication lines making up more of a neural network than any other city I know. There's a road, above which is a train line, above which is a motorway - and they all cut in between the sky scrapers in a way that asks the question... "which one was built first?".

In this photo, we look through the window of a skyscraper in Marunouchi, Tokyo, out towards the popular shopping districts of Ginza and Roppongi. The Tokyo train terminal is to the bottom right of the photo, where the subject is heading. The bullet trains really are something special. Whether you like trains or not, nothing is like being on one of these. The huge 16-carriage trains snake through Japan at 167mph every few minutes. They remind me of the asian depiction of a dragon, with its long, slender body and pointed nose.

Can you make out Tokyo Tower?

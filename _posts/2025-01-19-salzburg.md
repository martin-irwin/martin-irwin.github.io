Let’s get started with the customary Wikipedia entry, to save you the trouble:

> **Salzburg**[a] is the [fourth-largest city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Austria)in [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria). In 2020, it had a population of 156,852.[7]
> The town occupies the site of the Roman settlement of *Iuvavum*. Founded as an [episcopal see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_see) in 696, it became a [seat of the archbishop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-Archbishopric_of_Salzburg) in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction, trade, as well as gold mining. The [fortress of Hohensalzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohensalzburg_Fortress), one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a center of the [Counter-Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Reformation), with monasteries and numerous Baroque churches built.
>[Salzburg's historic center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Centre_of_the_City_of_Salzburg) ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *Altstadt*) is renowned for its [Baroque architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_architecture) and is one of the best-preserved city centers north of the Alps. The historic center was enlisted as a [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)[World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site) in 1996.[8] The city has three universities and a large student population.

In the pursuit of a very travel-friendly carry, I decided to take my trusty RX1 with me on this trip. It easily fits into my coat pocket, weighs next-to-nothing, and has a fantastic Zeiss 35mm F2 lens. 35mm is a focal length that I’ve settled into, but I can’t help but wonder if 28mm is actually my more suited length, if not 24mm. These are typically “wide” lenses, but I enjoy the perspective so much. It’s very rare for me to explore 50mm and longer focal lengths, but they indeed have their place.

Anyway, walking around Salzburg in temperatures of -2º – 1ºC made for a *very* refreshing trip. I decided to walk up the ***Kapuzinerberg***.

> **Kapuzinerberg** is a hill on the eastern bank of the [Salzach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzach) river in the [city of Salzburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg) in [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria), which rises to an elevation of 640 metres (2,100 ft). It is located to the north of [Salzburg's historic city centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altstadt_Salzburg), and forms part of the [city's UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Centre_of_the_City_of_Salzburg).[1][2]

It was a pleasure to walk through the forests on this hill, and breathe in the fresh air.

I hiked down and walked to the very pretty old town (*Altstadt*).

The following day, I repeated the hike, but came up the mountain from the other side.

It was quite comical at one point, as I was sliding ***up*** the side of the hill/mountain as my shoes had no grip and there was nothing but thick ice on the ground. But, I persevered and made it to the top.

On this day, the light was much better. But it was still [below] freezing.

Again I walked to the *Altstadt*, photo below.

And there we have it. Mozart’s birthplace, and the setting of **~The Sound of Music~**.

Until next time - possibly with more photos from the Japan trip(s)…

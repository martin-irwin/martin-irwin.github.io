The weather in Japan is in that strange transitional phase between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn. The temperature has dropped by about 10 degrees or so from last week (it's just 21℃ today), and there are frequent heavy showers, lightning and echoing thunder.

I spent the majority of my day off walking to various camera shops around Tokyo, marvelling at the intricate designs and high prices. I took a bit of a detour between shops and thought I would check out the [Robert Indiana sculpture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_(sculpture) "Love sculpture") I've not visited so far this year. I noticed this old chap reading a mail on his phone, and I rather fancied it was from someone special, and perhaps he'd call them.

Maybe.

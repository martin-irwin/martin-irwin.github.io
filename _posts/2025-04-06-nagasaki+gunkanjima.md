title: Nagasaki & Gunkanjima
excerpt: Nagasaki, a city steeped in global history and quiet charm, was my first destination in Japan back in 2006. Known as the site of the second atomic bomb, it also served as Japan’s only port open to foreign trade during the isolationist Shogunate era. From nostalgic reflections on film photography to testing out my new Sony A7CR, this visit blended the old and new. Highlights include the hauntingly iconic Gunkanjima (Battleship Island), featured in the James Bond film *Skyfall*, and the unique Western architecture that tells stories of merchants and diplomacy.

## Nagasaki City
I first went to Nagasaki in 2006, during my very first trip to Japan. Somewhere in a box, I have my little travel diary and some printed photos. This was back when digital cameras were emerging, and were pretty expensive. Japanese mobile phones had some decent cameras on them, but otherwise, basically everyone was using film cameras.

Today, film is something only for enthusiasts. Nobody is using film in for their holiday snaps, not really. The odd wedding or vacation can be complemented with a disposible camera, but that’s exactly my point. They’re a disposable camera. People aren’t going on holiday with rolls of film like they used to, and I wonder who can even change a roll of film in a camera in 2025.

Nagasaki 長崎 which appears to mean long bridge if my kanji reading skills are up to muster, is the largest city in 長崎県. It’s second famous to Hiroshima, as the site of the second atomic bomb to have been dropped on humans at the end of WWII.Somewhat ironically, for centuries Nagasaki was the only place in Japan to be open to foreign trade. During the Shogun era, Japan was locked down almost completely. Nagasaki was a trading post and housed a man-made island designed specifically for trade, such that foreigners needn’t step foot on the land of Japan itself.

It’s smaller than Hiroshima, and has some interesting areas (rebuilt after the bomb as basically the entire city was turned into rubble), housing western architecture, where rich noblemen and tradesmen had set up shop. It was at one of these locations that I met fellow brit === (hi if you’re reading!) and chatted a little about cameras. I had just purchased my Sony A7CR and was putting it through its paces. All of the posts on the blog over the last six months, save a couple, were taken with this camera.

## Gunkanjima

Putting the area back onto the map in 2012, the James Bond film Skyfall has a memorable scene where Bond meets the villian in his lair. This bizzare location of industrial decay and delapidation is 羽島島　Hashima Island, better known as 軍艦島 Gunkanjima, or Battle Ship Island, so called due to its resemblance to the Battleship Yamato when viewed from the shore.

*Gunkanjima* was a key site for undersea coal mining in Japan from the late 19th century until its closure in 1974. Purchased by Mitsubishi in 1890, the island became a hub of industrial activity, with its coal fueling Japan’s rapid modernisation and wartime expansion. To accommodate the growing workforce, the island was densely developed with concrete apartment blocks, making it one of the most densely populated places on Earth at its peak in the 1950s. Life on the island was harsh, especially for forced labourers brought from Korea and China during World War II under brutal conditions. After petroleum replaced coal as Japan’s primary energy source, the mine closed, and the island was abandoned, leaving behind a hauntingly preserved ruin of industrial ambition.

Gunkanjima was later reopened to tourists and gained UNESCO World Heritage status in 2015, though not without controversy due to its wartime history.

## Return East
Following our time in the West of Japan, it was time to return to the East. This was done with a series of bullet trains totalling around 8 hours of travel time in total. I think that I spent a lot of the journey editing photos, but also recall watching YouTube.

We had several days planned in Tokyo, before we returned back to Europe. A few more photos from Japan to follow, and then I’ll get back to a more timely update regarding life at present.

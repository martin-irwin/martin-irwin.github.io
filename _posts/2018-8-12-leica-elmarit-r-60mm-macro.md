As promised, here's some more action with the 60mm Leica Elmarit-R Macro. It's razor sharp, and has great colours. TBH there's little more you could want from a lens. It's weighty, but very well made. Focus ring is smooth and the aperture clicks are satisfying.

Full frame 60mm equates to 90mm on APS-C, which is a very useful focal length too, especially as a macro, or for landscapes.

The 1:1 crop of the photo above shows the sharpness of this lens; the plane and moon are clearly resolved. I’d say that picking up a macro lens of a slightly longer foca length is a great idea, though it’s sharpness is not _always_ desired for portrait photography. 

I’ll definitely post more with this lens in the future, so stay tuned.

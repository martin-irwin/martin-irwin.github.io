It's my fourth day off in 2012, the last being when my brother came to visit. Tomorrow, my parents come to visit. It'll be their first time to visit Japan (or Asia for that matter), and I still can't quite imagine them being here. They're being kind enough to bring over a little something I ordered last week, which will be explained in more detail when it's here ;)

Why the photo of my MacBook Pro? Well, the damn video card has packed in, or something. I can only basically see in 256 colours or some other kind of awful inverted hell. Only just about bearable for text, completely useless for any photography. Arse. I snapped this photo and then used the iPad camera connector to import the photo onto my iPad, from where I could upload to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTI5NTA2OTk?src=global9 "Dropbox") and sync to my laptop instantly. Had I the recently announced [NEX-6](http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/12/sony-nex-6-hands-on/), I could have sent the photo wirelessly. However, though the NEX-6 is a significant step up from my current NEX-C3, there are features other than wifi which I desire in my next camera :)

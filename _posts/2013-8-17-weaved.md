It's far too easy to take for granted the cleanliness of the streets in Japan.  At first it's quite shocking (obviously in a good way), but after a few years, complacency sets in. It's only after seeing streets in another major city, or if you make a really conscious effort, that you really notice it again.

EDIT: I discovered a shot I took in Ginza one Christmas, with a [similar theme](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/02/23/brickweave/)!

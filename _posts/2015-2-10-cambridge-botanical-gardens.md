A friend at work suggested that we pop to the botanical gardens at lunchtime, which I thought would be a great idea, even more so as I had my RX1 with me.

It was my first visit to the gardens, but frequent readers of the blog will know that I'm partial to the odd flower, tree, or plant.

The gardens didn't disappoint. Things will liven up, come Spring, so I'll be sure to return, probably with the A7R and a selection of lenses.

The RX1 is pretty versatile, though.

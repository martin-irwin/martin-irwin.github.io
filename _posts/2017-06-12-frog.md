The Common Frog is easily our most recognisable amphibian. They’re found throughout Britain and Ireland, in almost any habitat where suitable breeding ponds are near by. Common Frogs have smooth skin and long legs for jumping away quickly. Garden ponds are extremely important for common frogs, particularly in urban areas.

**Identification**Adults males grow up to 9 cm in length and females up to 13 cm in length.  Usually a shade of olive-green or brown (although can be yellow, pink, red, lime-green, cream or black).  Dark patches on the back, stripes on the hind legs, and a dark ‘mask’ behind the eye.  Oval, horizontal pupil.Call: soft repetitive croak.

**Distribution**Native to the UK.  Found throughout Britain and Ireland.Widespread and common across Europe but numbers thought to be declining.

**Ecology**Breed in shallow water bodies such as puddles, ponds, lakes, and canals.  Tend to be most active at night when they feed on a wide variety of invertebrates.  During winter they hibernate under rocks, in compost heaps, or underwater buried in mud and vegetation.Deposit ‘rafts’ of spawn, often containing up to 2000 eggs.  Each small black egg is surrounded by a clear jelly capsule around 1 cm across.  Common Frog tadpoles are black when they hatch but develop light bronze speckles as they mature.

**Predators and other threats**Threatened by degradation of habitats and the introduction of disease.

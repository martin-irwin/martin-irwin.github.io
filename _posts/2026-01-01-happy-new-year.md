My last post was written in November and somewhat erroneously posted on New Year's Day (due to my switching computer and syncing my GitHub account), but no bother. It's still valid, but it marks a fun start to the year.

I am lucky enough to be writing this post on my new MacBook Air with M4 chip. It's lightning fast, and I bought it to supercede my M1 Mac Mini that is slowly being relegated to server status. Also a brilliant machine, its main issue is that I can never take it anywhere with me. Fortunately, I have a 2015 MacBook 12" Retina, but it is an extremely weak machine in terms of processing power, so it lags behind heavily when it comes to general workloads. Even using browers in 2025 was taxing, as RAM requirements are through the roof.

I decided to get this laptop with a Japanese keyboard, which I've not actually typed on in quite some time. Overall the keyboard is more similar to the UK layout than the German keyboard, so I can touch type and enjoy the experience. Then it also has hiragana all over it, and a dedicated @ key, which is actually super handy in modern computing.

As I "only" have the 512GB SSD (but 24GB RAM), I have my Samsung SSD connected with a thunderbolt cable, to house my photos (and offload any other large files). It's been an age since I had a laptop as my "main" computer, so this will be interesting. I used to have a lot of concerns about battery usage, and laptops being plugged in all day every day, but I think this is mostly dealt with now.

At the end of last year, we were back in Japan to attend the wedding of one of my best friends. Though I was working, we also managed to get away for a couple of days and go skiing in the Japanese alps, which was fantastic. Some 50-70cm of snowfall (we were there right at the beginning of the season, so we were pretty lucky) and the weather was quite good (though pretty foggy, it was great fun).

It was basically a 2-week trip and was sandwiched between other life events, so it kind of came and went.

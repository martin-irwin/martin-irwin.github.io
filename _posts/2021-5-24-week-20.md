I’m technically a day late posting this image, as this Sunday was _Pfingsten (Pentecost, Whitsunday)_ and was the first time in about 18 months I’ve taken part in any kind of family gathering. Today is a national holiday, and is therefore “my Sunday” of sorts.

These photos are iPhone captures of an amazing double rainbow over Freiburg.

I decided to use the phone rather than run and grab the camera, as I knew it wouldn’t stay this strong for long. I probably should have taken a panorama as well, but instead decided to make use of the wide angle then take a couple of the 2x telephoto shots.

Around 7 years ago, I took a photo of another [double rainbow over Tokyo](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/10/3/double-rainbow), in case you’re interested!

Have a good week!

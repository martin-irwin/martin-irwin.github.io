I thought I'd close out January 2014 with a few photos from sometime in the last couple of weeks, taken around my neighbourhood in Tokyo.

I don't have a bike. As we originally intended to only stay for a year, we decided it wasn't a priority. Three years later, and I still don't have a set of wheels. This isn't so bad, though. In walking, one takes one's time a little more, and will see more than if just hurtling by on a bike. The same applies for cars vs cycling, and trains vs cars.

I hope that you've had a good start to 2014. It's Chinese New Year! Last year, [we embraced the crowds](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/02/12/gung-hay-fat-choy) in Yokohama's Chinatown. I'm not sure what we'll be doing this weekend.

For the above shot, I was in complete manual mode, which is just as well. It's nigh-on impossible to autofocus on a transparent object! Shortly after capturing this photo, the brisk breeze blew the bubble far away, and it popped.

Have a good weekend :)

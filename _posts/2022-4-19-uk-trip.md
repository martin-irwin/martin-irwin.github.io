A late-winter 2022 trip to the UK marked our first time to the UK since the pandemic. I would love to say that not much has changed, but Brexit makes my life a challenge on a daily basis, and if you voted for it, I hope you’re happy. Because I’m not.

We visited London for a few days, as I’ve not been a tourist there for quite some time, and I’ve not been there with Danielle before. We had all of these ideas and trips planned, back in 2019. Now it’s 2022 and we’re trying to remember the plans…

We visited the Natural History Museum. Possibly my favourite place in London, when I was growing up. My mother would take us both there for a morning/afternoon/day (no idea how long, we were children with no concept of time), and there is so much to see and learn about. I just soaked it up. It looks a little long in the tooth now; many exhibits are either off due to COVID, or are simply old and out of date. However, fossils are fossils, and there’s loads to see and learn.

We went to Harrods, the TATE Modern, and the British Museum. Loads of walking, and had Peking Duck in China Town.

At this point, FFP2 masks were still mandatory in Germany, but not in the UK, so it was quite a different feeling to witness all the open mouths filtering absolutely nothing. But the whole thing is a hoax anyway, right?

It’s extremely boring, so I will spare you the details, but I think I will move platforms with my website. I should put more of my photos onto stock photography, but website hosting prices have increased year after year and it’s got to a point where the ease of use of the platform doesn’t justify the cost. So, I expect when I remember, over the next months, the “format” of the website will change a little, depending on how you look at things. If you’re just coming here and reading the blog, especially from your phone etc, then little will have changed.

It’s been another fast week; the clocks changed last night here in Europe, so we’ve also “lost” another hour there. I was pretty busy with work—one day was a \[video\]conference from 8:30am to 6:30pm. This was exhausting in a completely different way to an in-person conference, which is also tiring. The conference itself suffered the fate of many; people taking up their entire slot “presenting” their work, leaving no time for discussion. This means discussion is moved to “lunch” and “coffee breaks” which is not how conferences should be. The entire point of gathering people together (vs all watching presentations on Youtube individually) is to make use of a platform for discussion, innovation, new ideas, and “networking”. Dear readers, if you have a presentation slot of 15 minutes, your talk is not 20 slides, lasting 15 minutes. Aim for < 15 slides, at 10 minutes. If there’s nothing to discuss, what are you even presenting…?

I’m keeping up with the rowing, listening to lots of music. My poor motorbike needs some TLC but at least the car is being used a little at the moment. It’s just about warm enough to go on some bike tours, and my bike could do with a service and a bit of TLC. Where is open in 2021? I haven’t really left these walls in over a year, and whilst I am OK, life is very different. I see the same 1-2 people month on month, and everything is done in front of a computer screen in isolation.

I hope week 13 is lucky for you, dear reader.

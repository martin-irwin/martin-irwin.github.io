I'd not picked up a camera for weeks. It happens, and can be a difficult phase through which to pass. I've been so busy visiting friends and family over the last month, including birthday celebrations, that I've simply not had time. And when I did have the time, I just wanted to relax. The weather is the typical British late summer/early autumn affair; it could rain at any minute or be a day of beautiful sunshine. I have been taking pictures with my phone on-and-off during the last few weeks, but it was this Sunday that I brought out the big gun, the A7R, and the excellent Zeiss Sonnar 55/1,8.

I've said numerous times, and I will no doubt continue to do so as my age increases, that 50mm is not my favourite focal length. Why did I buy this non-cheap lens, then? Aside from wanting it because it is fantastic, there are also situations for which 50mm excels. It's relatively easy to take a good portrait with a fast 50, but the real skill comes in not just using _bokeh_ everywhere. I'm happy to waffle on and on about which lenses for which purpose and all that, and if you are interested, do leave a comment or drop me an email.

For now, I will just show you the images I took yesterday (yes, this is all of them).

We're lucky to have moved to a much more photogenic place than our temporary home last year. I say luck, but really it was a lot of patience and [_nous_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous) on our part. We didn't sit around for a nice house and location to find us—we spent a year searching survivable (and by that I mean reasonably affordable, commutable, and sizeable) places in the UK in which to live.

And now we can spread our roots.

Walking around a manor house, we heard some line dancing or a _[cèilidh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A8ilidh),_ and found an old [WWII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) "fighting hole" through which we peeked. And I rather like the result.

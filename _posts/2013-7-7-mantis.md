I saw this little guy scuttle up to the top of a bollard. Only around 1inch (2.5cm) long, I crouched down and made use of the "touch-focus & capture" ability of my new Nokia Lumia 920. I'll do a review of the phone after I've had a little more time with it, but so far I am finding a lot to like. The camera is obviously pretty decent, as there's good detail on the mantis, and a pleasing out-of-focus background.

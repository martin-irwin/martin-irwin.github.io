Little activity, as I've been fighting some kind of stomach bug over the past few days, culminating in taking today off. I still got some work done from home, but slept through most of the morning as I felt totally rotten!

Regarding the photo; every now and then, I stumble across a much older building than those by which it is surrounded. Tokyo is so built up, so modern, and so shocked by earth-quakes, that most building are torn down and new ones built in their place every couple of decades. House prices are high, but the buildings are functional, clean and well built. Old ones like this always get me wondering. Who lives there? What do they do? How old is that house? How much longer will it fight off the bulldozers?

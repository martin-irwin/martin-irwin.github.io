Just a quick snap from one of my favourite lenses—the Leica 60mm Macro Elmarit-R. It's a heavy lens, and goes down to a 2:1 macro, which is very usable. It has superb sharpness and a beautiful bokeh. It's possibly the most versatile lens in my lineup.

Using a 60mm lens for landscapes is a great idea. Indoor architecture shots will work quite nicely too (focussing on the details), and the close working distance and macro ability of the lens will mean that if you **really** want to get into details, you can.

The above shot is a handheld snap of some roses. I wanted to make use of some negative space, hence not filling the entire screen and am pleased with the composition. I particularly like the softness of the rose to the right and behind the main rose, as well as the leaves below.

Shot at 1/60 s and handheld, ISO 500. The A7R [shutter slap](https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/53321125) issue rarely manifests itself in my photos—usually I'm the one making errors and not the camera. And a tiny loss of sharpness never stops a powerful image making its point or reduces a great image to a mediocre one.

Expect more from this lens soon...

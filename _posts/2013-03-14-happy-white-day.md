_Happy White Day │ NEX-7 & SEL24F18Z │ 24mm, ISO 200, f/4, 1/60, RAW_

What girl doesn't like being woken up with a little card and box of chocs? Charlie certainly seemed pretty happy this morning! Though she'd forgotten that today was [White Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Day), I certainly hadn't. I'd [previously written](/martin-irwin-photography/2013/02/14/happy-valentines-day "Happy Valentine’s Day!") that on the 14th Feb, girls are to give their loved ones a card (and maybe some chocolates), but that on the 14th of March, the boys reciprocate with a \[larger\] box of chocolates. Here, however, the men don't get the women a card. I guess cards are too girly? Well, after much searching, I found one, nevertheless.

The term _sanbai gaeshi_ (三倍返し, "thrice the return") is used to describe this rule. Not returning the gift is perceived as the men placing himself in a position of superiority, even if excuses are given. Returning a present of equal value is considered as a way to say that you are ending the relationship.

I think Charlie knows the score ;)

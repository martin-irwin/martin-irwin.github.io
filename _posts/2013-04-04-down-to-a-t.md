_Down to a T | NEX-7 & SEL24F18Z | 24mm, f/2, ISO 400, 1/100, RAW_

I've just figured out how to publish an image properly on my blog, keeping its RSS information intact. Sweet.

Later today I'll try something else; editing and posting from my Nexus 7. I'm writing this on my Nexus 7 right now, but this photo was uploaded from my computer last night.

More about the photo... it's one of the many walls of the [Tsutaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_Convenience_Club) in Daikanyama. Tsutaya is a book, music, game, and film rental chain in Japan, which is still very much popular in this digital age. Buying goods at other shops with a compatible credit card around Japan, will get you store credit here. The so-called "T-Point" can be found in many shops and coffee places, giving a strong incentive to pay a visit to Tsutaya for your next media fix.

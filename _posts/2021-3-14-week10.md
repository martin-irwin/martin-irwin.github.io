On one hand, flowers are a photographer’s “get out of jail” card. Still life photography is hugely popular, and rightly so. As with everything, there are people thinking that their way is more “worthy” or valuable. Street photographers might say that without people in a scene, there is no real scene. Landscape photographers might say that people in fact ruin scenes. Astrophotographers will say that anything over a few photons is too much light, and macro photographers require huge light rigs in order to illuminate their subject matter.

Either way, my reason is simple. I walked into the kitchen and saw the roses beautifully illuminated by the morning light. I’d have taken a photo even if I wasn’t writing the weekly posts, but being as it was Friday in a very busy week, here we are.

There’s fresh snow on the mountains, and though Spring is clearly on the way, we are not there yet. Our economies cannot survive forever with “lockdown”, or at least, how we remembered them. This year is an important milestone in the COVID saga.

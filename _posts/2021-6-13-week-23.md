Yesterday was an almost “normal” day. Despite calls in the media for everything to change and for us to not “get back to normal” (usually angled regarding climate change, pollution, work-life balance, etc), it was much needed to have a day out in a nearby city, doing a bit of shopping, having a nice lunch, coffee and gelato, and then a drink and dinner at a rooftop bar.

Aside from the requirement to wear a mask whenever indoors, things were indeed pretty much pre-pandemic. Of course I wear a mask (surgical mostly) when inside, but the “one size fits all”, like baseball caps, to not fit my head. After about 15 minutes my ears really start to hurt, so it’s a little uncomfortable. Of course, breathing is naturally restricted somewhat, but we all know what that feels like these days. No real big deal for most of us, really.

Sitting outside, in good weather though… superb.

It’s hard to pick a highlight of the day, but it was possibly stripping down to swim trunks to dip into the lovely clear lake Zürich to cool down. After being on your feet for hours, in hot summer sun, it’s such a nice contrast that really refreshes the body and mind.

Closely followed in second place by the subsequent e-scooter trip back from the lake to the centre of town. That was great fun, too.

I’d quite fancy perhaps an electric/hybrid car, that had two e-scooters always fully charged in the boot (trunk). I remember the whole segway craze kicking off, and though those are quite cool, they’re huge and best for law enforcement or crowd control in airports etc, in my view. Nothing beats making short work of getting across a city on one of these e-scooters. More comfortable than a bicycle and more convenient, too.

Anyway, it was great to have a full day out of the apartment, feeling “normal” again.

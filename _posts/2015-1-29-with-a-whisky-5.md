**_Written whilst enjoying a single malt, "With a Whisky" brings you the latest ramblings from my side of the world. I can't promise prominent prose, or impressive imagery, but I'll do my best to keep you entertained._**

Aren't orchids rather lovely?

In the previous instalment, I was asked to expand a little on my choice of whisky; namely my choice "single malt". I have a few favourites, but in all honesty, am still in something of an experimental phase. However, tonight, I am drinking...

_Laphroaig, Aged 10 Years._

When you pop open the top of the bottle (which makes a fantastic sound), you're presented with very smokey, peat notes. Though I don't smoke, this is one of those whisky's making you wish for a cigar & smoking jacket...

This particular Laphroaig (Aged 10 Years) is recommended by the distillery themselves to be drank with water (i.e. mixed). I wasn't aware until relatively recently, but drinking whisky in this manner is actually very popular with connoisseurs. In doing so, one will notice many more flavours, and draw away from that sometimes overpowering "punch" that a such strong alcohol can deliver (if you're not used to it). It makes sense, if you think about it physicochemically.

There are definitely spicy tones, but it's mostly be the oaky, smokey, peaty flavours which surround the tongue. I'd be lying if I didn't say that there isn't a medicinal taste to this single malt—something akin to TCP or E45 antiseptic cream, which sounds disgusting, but is quite the opposite.

Did I sound like I knew what I was talking about?

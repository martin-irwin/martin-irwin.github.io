I attended another Tokyo "Drink and Click" last night, and had a great time taking long-exposure shots around the Marunouchi area of Tokyo. 

Most people had rather large tripods, with large DSLRs mounted atop. Someone even asked me if I had a camera with me, as mine was tucked away in a small leather shoulder bag.

It's very humid in Tokyo these days, and there is typically lots of haze all-day, though this is exacerbated by the drop in temperature after sunset. It's 30ºC as I write this, yet the height of summer is still a few months away...

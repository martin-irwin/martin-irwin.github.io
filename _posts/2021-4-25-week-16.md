I am so pleased to be able to post these photos. Things were a little touch-and-go last Sunday; this little foal was born in the early hours, and the mother (the horse Danielle rides) wasn’t producing much milk, and the foal wasn’t taking the bottle directly.

We spent a few hours there trying to feed (tbh I was there taking photos and offering support from the sidelines), and it was estimated to be a 50-50 chance she’d make it.

Fast forward a week, and the little blighter is doing brilliantly. Mum looks happy too :)

We arrived in Hiroshima, and the next day took a trip to the famous and picture-postcard island of Itsukushima. Those of you with the blog since the early days, will note I was here [around 12 years ago](/blog/itsukushima-shrinemiyajima-hiroshima-pt-3/). The island is more commonly known as Miyajima, ~[Japanese](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e621.html)~ for "shrine island." This name reflects the island's close connection to its principal shrine, ~[Itsukushima Shrine](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3450.html)~. Similar to the torii gate, the shrine's main buildings are constructed over water.

Miyajima (宮島) is a small island less than an hour outside the city of ~[Hiroshima](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2160.html)~. It is most famous for its giant ~[torii gate](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2059.html)~, which at high tide appears to float on the water. This sight is ranked as one of Japan's ~[three best views](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2250.html)~.

It’s a tourist hotspot, and we were indeed tourists, so you have to be patient to take “your shot” of the famous *Torii* gate. It would almost be bizarre to have no-one here, it’s such a special location and while modern tourism as we know it didn’t exist, the island was an important pilgrimage site.

The iconic **Itsukushima Shrine** dates back to at least the **12th century**, when *Taira no Kiyomori*, a powerful samurai and court noble, helped establish it as a major Shinto site. Before that, the island had religious significance in Japan’s native Shinto beliefs. As Miyajima itself is considered sacred, commoners were traditionally not allowed to set foot on the island, and those who did had to approach via boat to the shrine, avoiding disturbing the sacred land.

During the **Edo period (1603–1868)**, as domestic travel became more common, Miyajima was a popular pilgrimage destination for people visiting famous religious sites. The island’s beauty, combined with its religious significance, made it well-known among travelers, poets, and artists.

Today’s “tourist attractions” are something quite different, but Miyajima was definitely a famous and revered place that drew many visitors even centuries ago.

> Miyajima is a romantic destination, best experienced by staying overnight at one of the island's ~[ryokan](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2029.html)~. While the island bustles with tourists during the day, evenings bring a quieter, more peaceful atmosphere. Wild deer roam the island and have grown accustomed to human presence. During daylight hours, they wander among tourist sites, and at night, they rest along the ~[walking paths](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3456.html)~. Unlike their counterparts in ~[Nara](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2165.html)~, visitors must not feed the deer on Miyajima.

> The island has several important temples besides Itsukushima Shrine, including Daisho-in, a significant Shingon Buddhist temple. Miyajima is also known for its local specialties such as momiji manju (maple leaf-shaped cakes) and wooden rice scoops (shakushi), which are considered lucky souvenirs.

>During autumn, the island's maple trees turn brilliant shades of red and orange, making it a popular koyo (autumn leaves) viewing spot. Cherry blossoms in spring also attract many visitors. The island hosts several festivals throughout the year, including the Miyajima Water Fireworks Festival in August.

We spent a few hours walking around the Shrine, with no pressure on where to go or what to do.

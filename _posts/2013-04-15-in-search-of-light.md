_In search of lightÂ | NEX-C3 & Canon nFD 50mm F1.4 | 50mm, f/1.4, ISO 200, 1/3200, RAW_ These lilies need no lessons in learning where the light is. They clearly point towards the slender gap in the curtain, soaking up as many rays as possible. I find myself on a similar path, pointing my camera to maximise the amount of incident light. These lilies tend to grow rather rapidly in the land of the rising sun, so I'll post a progress report in a couple of days.

Macro? Zeiss? Abstract? Same position?

I'll have a think, but I'll always listen to a suggestion!

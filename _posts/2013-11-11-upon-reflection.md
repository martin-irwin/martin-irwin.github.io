Sometime last week, though I can't remember when, the clouds briefly parted and a few rays of sunlight burst through the gap.

I ventured out with my NEX-7 and Canon FD 50mm lens, to the pond next to my office building. Some of the trees have started their descent into fall colours already.

It had been raining not long before, an there remained a significant amount of water on the leaves of the numerous trees surrounding the lake. I didn't have to wait long to take the below photograph, though perhaps _upon reflection_ I should have waited for another drop, more central to the frame.

Everything's easy when you know how. I had found that clicking links at the end of my blog, to get to page 2 or 3, was landing users with an error 404, "page not found". This was annoying, to say the least. I did a lot of trawling through the net, where this error is [in abundance](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=page%2F2%2F+wordpress+not+found).

I didn't find the answer there, though it may be there.

The answer is very simple; to rename one's blog. Calling the blog "blog", sends the site in all sorts of loops, as I have a category called **blog**, a page called **blog** and the blog is called **blog**. Now, my blog is called **myblog**, and everything works as it should.

Easy. When you know how.

_Final Blossoms | NEX-7 & SEL24F18Z | 1/1250, f/2.2, ISO100, 24mm, RAW_

The final blossoms are falling here in Tokyo, making way for the lush greens of the upcoming rainy season. There have been some collossal winds, and a bit of rain, so not many blossoms remain. The beginning of this week had some gorgeous sunlight, though. It was a little cloudy today, but the weather looks a little better this weekend, so I'll have my NEX batteries charged.

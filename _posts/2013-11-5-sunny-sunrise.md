It seems that I'm forever saying that the weather will improve, only for the weekend to be a wash-out. This last weekend was, again, a damp and dreary affair. We're wanting to go on the long walks we so enjoy this time of year, but the weather just doesn't want to cooperate.

We woke up this morning to bright sunlight coming through the skylight, birds tweeting, and a clear-sky forecast. Typical! A day inside an office until sunset (at 4:44pm!), and it's glorious outside. Oh well. I snapped the above photo through the condensation-covered window, pictured below.

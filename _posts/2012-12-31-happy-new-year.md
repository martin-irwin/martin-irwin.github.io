_Happy New Year! │ NEX-7 & Sigma 30mm F2.8 │ 30mm, ISO 100, f/5, 1/30_ Well, I've finally got the sigma 30mm for E-mount. On sale today, at ¥10,800, it was a steal. I've been uhming and ahing over this lens for months now, and finally decided to just get the damn thing... and boy am I glad!

I've tested the corner sharpness on this lens, and it is one of the sharpest lenses in my growing collection. The 19mm was a similar price, but I have two kit lenses which perform well at that focal length, with OSS, and if I want wide, I want wider... namely the 8mm samyang fisheye (next target?).

It's no secret that I am a fan of Android devices - and I have managed to collect a few android figurines since I moved to Japan. Here's a little photo of them.

A happy new year, to all!

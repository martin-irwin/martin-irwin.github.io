_Hometime │_ __NEX-7 & _Voigtländer Nokton Classic 35mm F1.4_ │ 35mm, 1/100, _ISO 1600, f/4, -2.9EV, Lightroom 4.2___ Hometime. I remember that word. Is it a real word? Perhaps. I don't remember saying it after around the age of 15-16 years old. Hometime. It usually meant leaving the confines of school at around 3pm or so, and going home, to essentially complete freedom. No bills to pay, no food to prepare, nothing to do other than whatever my brother and I wanted. Football for 2 hours before tea? Sure! Cricket? No problem. Tennis in the road before the rush hour? Your serve. Then after tea... more fun. Maybe a little homework... I can't remember so well. Spot of TV and then bedtime.

Hometime. Now, "hometime" is around 7pm. Luckily though, we live in Tokyo. Downside is  - I have to [play sardines](http://www.break.com/usercontent/2008/4/train-packed-like-sardines-485055) every single morning and night when getting on a train. Upside is the culture, food and general conveniences in the metropolis. Of course, now I have a swish computer and a super duper camera. When I was 15 I didn't have either. I also didn't consume nearly an entire bottle of Rioja on a Friday night with my evening meal. I wouldn't trade one for the other, but it's good to have had both experiences.

I wonder what lies ahead.

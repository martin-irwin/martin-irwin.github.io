The site is back up and running, but the import tool has only imported text, and not the images, from the last few months of 2021. Not a big deal, but a little annoying for my OCD.

We decided to make the most of a gap in the gale-force winds and hike up the Kandel mountain in the black forest. It’s 1241m, and there’s quite a bit of snow at the peak.

The path up (there are multiple) was nice and dry, with the odd patch of snow here and there.

The last time we were up there was the beginning of 2020, right at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 years later, not much has changed, but the time has flown.

You can see a few more snow-photos from 2 years ago, [here](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/the-white-forest?rq=kandel). There was much more snow, then, and as we drove up, my hands were warmer than they were yesterday, and thus I could take more photos!

It took us about 3 hours up, and we stopped for food a couple of times. It also took us 3 hours back down, but we had a bit more of a challenging decent through some snowy and icy terrain.

It was a great day out, finished off with my home-made spaghetti bolognese and a nice bottle of red wine.

After being on the road for 3 weeks, for the first time in 2 years, it was nice to get out and about in the local area. It’s something I’ve promised myself to do more of, through 2022. So, I expect more photos to be generated this year, also.

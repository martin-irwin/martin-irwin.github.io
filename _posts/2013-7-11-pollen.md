I rarely use my macro lens outside of the house, probably as its 30mm focal length is duplicated by the smaller and slightly faster [sigma lens](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/01/01/sigma-30mm-nex-e-mount). I'm not sure which lens is officially sharper, but I've found the sigma to be [extremely capable](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/?tag=sigma). Having said that, the Sony macro lens for E-mount is very sharp, and has a minimum focussing distance of ~1cm - useless for shy animals, but great for plants and food.

Anyway, the above photo is a crop from a handheld shot of a flower (click it for a larger file). I saw the flowers at the side of the road, and wanted to take a photo to show my brother the resolving power of the NEX-7 vs his Galaxy S3. His phone took a great photo, but only when I digitally zoomed in on the flower did we notice a small insect atop the pollen! We struggled to make out the insect with our eyes!

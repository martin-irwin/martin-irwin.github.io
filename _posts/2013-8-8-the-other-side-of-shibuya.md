Shibuya is a multi-layered behemoth of a district. There are roads above train lines above roads above tunnels. I wanted a photo showing another layer, the _other side_ of Shibuya.

Shibuya can be somewhat glamorous, with expensive shops and department stores, but is typically associated as being a teenage or youth district, with the famous _109 building_ in its centre. The kids dress funky, and the place never seems to be quiet. Though it's still a relatively clean place (though probably dirty by Tokyo standards), there are thousands of stickers to be found, if you look close enough.

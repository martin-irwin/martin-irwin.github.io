I'm currently waiting to board my [ANA 787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner) to Beijing (interestingly, still called _Peking_ in Japanese). It'll be my first time to visit mainland China, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what it's like. I'm departing from Tokyo's Haneda International Airport, which to my knowledge, does not serve long-haul flights to Europe and other destinations. Located just an hour from my apartment, I always prefer to travel from Haneda rather than take a 2-hour journey out to Narita Airport on the far east side of Tokyo.

If I manage to get internet access in China, I'll update the blog as I go. If I don't then, expect a lot of photos starting next weekend.

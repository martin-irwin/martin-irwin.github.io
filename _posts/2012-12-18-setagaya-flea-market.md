This weekend, we took a stroll to the local flea market, the “Setagaya Boro-ichi” (せたがやぼろいち), which takes place in Setagaya ward on the 15th and 16th of December (and January) each year. This market is the oldest flea market in Tokyo, and has been an bi-annual event since the 16th Century.

The above shot was taken from the viewpoint of the “Daikandokoro” (代官所), the old Magistrate's office. Apparently, this location is the original spot of this market, all that time ago.

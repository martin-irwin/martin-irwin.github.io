These two photos were taken within a few seconds of each other at the top of my work building, outside in the rain. In the top image, I focussed on the horizon. In the lower image, I manually focussed on a plane of falling rain, in an attempt to catch the raindrops mid-flight.

After just [dodging the rain this morning](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/8/6/narrowly-missed-the-rain), I wanted to keep dry. I just about achieved the look I was after with these photos, but I didn't have long. Soon after the lower shot was taken, I hurried inside to the safety of my building, protected from the lashing rain of the storm outside.

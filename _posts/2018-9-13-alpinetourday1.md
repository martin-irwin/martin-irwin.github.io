Taking the back roads, avoiding Autobahns, we left early on Saturday morning in the direction of the Alps. Warming up the tyres on the bikes on some well trodden tracks between Zurich and Zug, I knew it was going to be a great weekend. First on the schedule was the famous (thanks to Goldfinger) Furka Pass.

Suffice it to say, it’s a great driving road, with some great corners, and a great view for the entire course of the road.

Snaking through some of the most literally _awesome_ landscape I’ve ever seen was really quite an experience. The _Grimsel Pass_ was a more involving ride than _Furka_, not wishing to take anything away from one or the other, but it was simply excellent turn after turn. I mean, look at the satellite view in the image above. Those corners! I learnt more about riding a motorbike there in an hour than in weeks of riding around the streets of a city.

_“The_ **_Grimsel Pass_** _(_[_German_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language "German language")_: Grimselpass;_ [_French_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language "French language")_: Col du Grimsel) is a_ [_mountain pass_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pass "Mountain pass") _in_ [_Switzerland_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland")_, crossing the_ [_Bernese Alps_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Alps "Bernese Alps") _at an elevation of 2,164 metres (7,100 ft). The pass connects the_ [_Haslital_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haslital "Haslital")_, the upper valley of the river_ [_Aare_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aare "Aare")_, with the upper valley of the_ [_Rhône_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh%C3%B4ne "Rhône")_. In so doing, and as the Aare is a tributary of the_ [_Rhine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine "Rhine")_, the pass crosses the_ [_continental divide_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_divide "Continental divide") _between the_ [_North Sea_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea "North Sea") _and the_ [_Mediterranean Sea_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea")_._

_A paved road follows the pass, running 38 kilometres (24 mi) from_ [_Gletsch_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gletsch "Gletsch") _to_ [_Meiringen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiringen "Meiringen")_. The road is normally closed between October and May, due to the high snowfall on the pass. As it is the only direct road pass between the cantons of_ [_Bern_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Bern "Canton of Bern") _and_ [_Valais_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais "Valais") _across the Bernese Alps, attempts are made to keep the road open as long as possible with_ [_snow ploughs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_plough "Snow plough")_. A_ [_PostBus Switzerland_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostBus_Switzerland "PostBus Switzerland") _service uses the pass several times a day, connecting_ [_Meiringen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiringen "Meiringen") _and_ [_Oberwald_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberwald "Oberwald")_._

_The Grimsel Pass road is part of the_ [_Aare Route_](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aare_Route&action=edit&redlink=1 "Aare Route (page does not exist)")_, which is_ [_national cycle route_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_National_Bike_Routes "Swiss National Bike Routes") _8 of Switzerland. It has been used on several occasions by the_ [_Tour de Suisse_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_Suisse "Tour de Suisse")_.”_

**_Susten Pass_** _(German: Sustenpass) (el. 2260 m.) is a_ [_mountain pass_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pass "Mountain pass") _in the_ [_Swiss Alps_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Alps "Swiss Alps")_. The pass road, built from 1938–1945, connects_ [_Innertkirchen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innertkirchen "Innertkirchen") _in the canton of_ [_Bern_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Bern "Canton of Bern") _with_ [_Wassen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassen "Wassen") _in the canton of_ [_Uri_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Uri "Canton of Uri")_. A 300 metres long tunnel crosses the pass at 2,224 metres._

_The pass is popular with tourists, especially for the views of the_ [_Stein Glacier_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_Glacier "Stein Glacier") _on the south side._

I think _Susten Pass_ is actually my favourite of the passes, with some amazing long, sweeping corners. Simply amazing. I took some video footage but haven’t gotten around to more than glimpse at it thus far.

We finished off the first day with a jaunt back to Brunnen where we had a hotel layover to avoid having to take the Autobahn back to Zurich and then back out again on Sunday morning, where we had an even longer day planned…

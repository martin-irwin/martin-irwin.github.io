My brother and his family visited in August, so most photos won't be shared here to respect privacy, especially that of children. It's 2025, and the internet becomes an increasingly isolated and darker place, in stark contrast to the freedom I recall of 2000s - 2020.

In any case, I have a major update in a life achievement: I've now learned 2300 Kanji! I will write this up properly, as there isn't time now, but wanted to share this huge milestone.

I had planned on taking my camera with my yesterday on a bike tour, but couldn’t find the strap for the bag, and so just enjoyed the ride. That means it’s another week of apartment-based photography.

I think the first shot is taken at 28mm with a relatively slow shutter speed, perched on the kitchen table. The second and third photos are shot using the Zeiss Ultron 50mm F1.8 ([which I reviewed here](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/carl-zeiss-ultron-50f18-review)), which has a concave front element and a very pleasing rendering style. It’s also incredibly sharp.

The lens has this amazing water-colour feel to its rendering and is actually very unlike most lenses. Check out a near 100% crop of the above photo…

The church towers look essentially “normal” with nothing surprising going on, but check out the trees in the fore-and background. The rendering on the trees is almost surreal, yet sharp. It’s not really a softening of the image, but really a “rendering”. Very peculiar and one could spend a lifetime calculating this using the [Lens Maker’s Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens#Lensmaker's_equation) amongst other things, but here we will simply enjoy it.

Happy 4th of July to my American friends.

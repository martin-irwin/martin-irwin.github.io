I'm back in Okinawa - this time for work - but rather than post uninspiring and dull photos of work (plus, this site is my hobby - to escape work!), I have a few photos from my lunch break at the very northern tip of Okinawa's main island. I spent a few minutes with my NEX-7 and manual lens chasing the amazing butterfly in the shot above...

I'll be here all week, but the weather forecast isn't so great. Who knows, though. Okinawa has crazy weather!

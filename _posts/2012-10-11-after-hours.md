_After Hours_│ NEX-C3 & _SEL 16mm  F2.8_ │ 16mm, _ISO 1600, f/8, 1/20, 0EV___ Sunset's at around 5pm now, so I won't be leaving the office in daylight hours until sometime in 2013. Sunrise is 5:45am, so at least that helps me not feel like a zombie. The sun is extremely bright all the year round here in Japan - even in winter. The temperature's taken a bit of a dive this week, but it's certainly not "cold". The leaves haven't started to turn yet...

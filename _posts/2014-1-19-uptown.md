In contrast to [yesterday's post](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2014/1/18/ascension), the area of Aoyama (Blue Maountain) in central Tokyo is about as upmarket as one can get before the famous [_Ginza_ district](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2014/1/2/ginza).

We don't really do any shopping here, but it's an interesting place to visit, and I do enjoy seeing (and hearing) Ferraris and Lamborghinis driving around.

The above building is quite striking - any ideas which building it is? I also have the shot in colour - which do you prefer?

The sky was the typical pastel blue which characterises the Japanese winter. Oh how I will miss this some day. The UK this time of year is much wetter, and often cloudier. Though temperatures here are similar (~5ºC), it's possible to warm up a little by standing in the sunlight. However, once the sun goes down, you'd better have a hat!

  
There's not much else going on (festivities-wise) this time of year, but adverts for Valentine's Day have already appeared to keep the mind of the consumer focussed on something. Valentine's Day is an odd one in Japan - [I've covered it previously](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/02/14/happy-valentines-day). 

I really enjoy the long shadows we're granted all-day-round during the winter. It's become one of my favourite seasons for photography, even if it means bracing the biting cold.

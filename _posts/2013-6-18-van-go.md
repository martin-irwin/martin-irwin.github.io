June's passing in a blur. It's almost July! The weather has gone from a pleasant spring, to a muggy and humid rainy season in full-swing. Today's weather was extremely humid, and though there was no rain during any of my commute, the gusty winds made for an all-round unpleasant experience!

I should add that I have finally given in and started my air conditioning system. The ice-cool breeze is very refreshing; outside it's 30Â°C and around 90% humidity...

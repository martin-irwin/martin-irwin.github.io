Rainy season really is rainy season. In the last week, we've only had a few hours without rain. I was lucky enough to be in Shibuya during one of those hours.

A cold front meant temperature dropped from 30ºC to 20ºC overnight, and brought colossal thunderstorms, and intense rain. The kind of rain that floods the UK after a day or two. No doubt there are landslides and floods in remote areas, but Japan has [incredible draining systems](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/g-cans-worlds-largest-drain).

The last two photos were taken with the latest addition to my lens stable. It's a lens I've been trying to source for well over a year, and I'm happy to finally have it in my possession. All was not well, as it arrived with sticky aperture blades, which I fixed myself. It's the first time I've done something like that, but I'm a bit of a hands-on guy. It's working fine now, and has gone straight into my top 3 favourite lenses. More on it another time :)

As I've been rather busy of late, and the weather's been terrible, I haven't found myself picking up my camera. It was pleasant to take it with me to Shibuya – it's small enough to fit into my shoulder bag without much effort. In my opinion, this is the real benefit of mirrorless cameras. I know for a fact that I would love a huge Canon DSLR, but I wouldn't take it out with me on random walks.

And then I couldn't take photos like this!

Unless you're sadistic, I've say this is one of the worst times to visit Tokyo. It's up their with August for sheer levels of discomfort. Humidity of 95% is not fun for anyone, nor cameras!

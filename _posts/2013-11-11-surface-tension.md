I've always been fascinated by pond-skaters.  They seem to defy the laws of physics, though they are perhaps merely ambassadors. The overcast skies made for an almost liquid-metal backdrop for this photo. Was this photo easy to take? No. He was up there with [the butterfly shot](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/8/29/butterfly-flyby) in terms of difficulty.

He was very fast, and rested for a second or two between darting to the next position. I had my manual focus 90mm F2.8 lens attached to my NEX-7, and though focus peaking is helpful, I really had to zoom in to be able to make my best guess. The  photo above is almost a 100% crop from the ISO100 NEX-7 file. I was quite happy with the result!

A continued theme of _surface tension_ woke us up early on Sunday morning, with an M5.5 earthquake (epicentre just north of Tokyo). As always, it's a humbling reminder of our place in this world, and we're treading on thin ice.

At 6pm, the bells of the Munster in the centre of town can be heard every day. It was at 6pm that the bells made me turn my head away from the monitor, to see a rain showed outside. However, I noticed that the setting sun was shining extremely strongly, and that the rain must be relatively localised. I thought that at exactly opposite the sun, I would see a rainbow, and grabbed my camera on the way to the living room.

I did not expect, however, that the rainbow would be landing perfectly on the spire of the Munster in the centre of town, and took a couple of quick shots, then stood and appreciated the rainbow until it was only a memory, and a digital file on my camera.

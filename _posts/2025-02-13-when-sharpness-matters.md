title: When sharpness matters
excerpt: In the world of high-resolution photography, sharpness and megapixels often take centre stage. However, as I reflect on my experience with Sony’s powerful A7CR and its impressive 61 MP sensor, I realise that sometimes, it’s not the technical specs that matter most. For this image, shot with my sharpest lens, the SEL55F18ZA, it’s the atmosphere, the moment, and the feeling that take precedence. Gear is just a tool — the art of photography lies in the story we capture, not in the megapixels we use to do so.

## Or, when sharpness doesn't matter

Taking this photo with a 61 megapixel full-frame camera, using arguably my sharpest lens (the venerable SEL55F18ZA)... it can be funny how none of this comes together as being remotely important in this type of image:

I started using this lens on the A7R, which has 36.4MP. I keep wanting more and more MP, and they come in handy when you want to go macro, or zoom in a lot, but otherwise, anything over 10MP will be great for me and I will be just fine! The RX1 that I have is 24MP and some of my best images are taken using that camera. 

[This article](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/blog/2014/04/13/a7r-vs-rx1.html) of mine backs up these opinions...

A great photo is not made from the equipment. This becomes more and more evident to me as I spend more and more money on equipment. I'll summarise some technical stats below for your interest.

# Sony A7R vs Sony A7CR: Comparison

| Feature         | Sony A7R (Mark I) | Sony A7CR |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Megapixels** | 36.4 MP | **61.0 MP** |
| **Sensor** | Full-frame CMOS | Full-frame BSI CMOS |
| **Processor** | BIONZ X | BIONZ XR |
| **ISO Range** | 100–25,600 | 100–32,000 (expandable to 50–102,400) |
| **Autofocus** | Contrast-detect AF (25 points) | Hybrid AF (759 phase-detect + 25 contrast) |
| **IBIS (Stabilisation)** | ❌ No IBIS | ✅ 7-stop IBIS |
| **Max Burst Rate** | 4 fps | 8 fps |
| **Video** | 1080p @ 60fps | 4K @ 60fps, 10-bit 4:2:2 |
| **Viewfinder** | 2.4M-dot EVF | 2.36M-dot EVF |
| **LCD Screen** | Fixed, 3.0" | Vari-angle, 3.0" |
| **Weight** | ~465g | ~515g |
| **Release Year** | 2013 | 2023 |

## Key Differences:
- The **A7CR** has **61 MP**, nearly **double** the **36.4 MP** of the **A7R**.  
- The **A7CR** has **IBIS (in-body stabilisation)**, while the A7R does not.  
- The **A7CR** has a **much better autofocus system**, with 759 phase-detect points compared to the **A7R’s** basic 25 contrast-detect points.  
- **Video quality** is significantly better on the A7CR (**4K 60p, 10-bit 4:2:2** vs. **1080p 60p** on the A7R).  
- **The A7CR is 10 years newer**, meaning **better low-light performance, dynamic range, and overall image quality**.

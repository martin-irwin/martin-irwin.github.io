I've been to Asakusa 「浅草」 many times over the years, but I've not been back here for around a year or so. The temple of [_Sensoji_](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/01/21/sensoji) 「浅草寺」is a very popular all-year tourist attraction, and basically, I try to avoid those.

The area is, however, rather photogenic. As it'd been so long, and there's something about _New Year_ and temples, we decided to take the hour-long journey from our place in west Tokyo, to the eastern side. In order to do so, one heads for the HDTV beacon known as _Tokyo_ [_Sky Tree_](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/9/24/goroawase).

The temples are full of thousands of little details - almost too many to take in. Fighting my way through groups taking "selfies", I once more made use of my considerable height advantage.

I find it rather amusing when I stop to take a photograph, because I've seen something, and a small group will gather around me, phones, cameras, and _iPads_ (?) at the ready. The people try to understand exactly what I'm looking at, but perhaps it's nothing in particular, and just a certain light or reflection which has piqued my interest. I've even gone as far to fake seeing something interesting, for my own amusement :)

恭喜发财!! Happy New Year to all (number 2). The Chinese Year of the snake has officially started. We celebrated by going to the world's largest chinatown just outside of Tokyo, in the city of Yokohama. Busy isn't quite the word...

For photography at events I have a bit of an advantage, being 6ft2/187cm. I lose this advantage anywhere else in Japan, though (with the population being so much smaller, many rooms are miniaturised). Anyway, I could easily see over the crowd, and snapped away.

The "lion dance" was quite spectacular, in which the performers pay impromptu visits to local shops and restaurants in order to bring them luck for the coming year. Firecrackers galore.

There was also loads of amazing food (the smells were amazing), and everywhere we looked, someone was eating a tasty morsel or two.

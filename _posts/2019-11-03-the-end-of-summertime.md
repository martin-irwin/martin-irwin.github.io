Light becomes a premium during the winter time, when we are back to GMT (or for me these days, CET) and it’s dark when you wake up, and dark when you get home from work. The constant rain (yes, Germany, you have lots of rain in Autumn too, it seems) and dark skies really do not lend themselves well to photography.

The most readily acceptable photographic endeavour would be indoors macro photography, I imagine. That’s in part because I don’t want to go outside in weather like this. Having said that, the end of October had a couple of dry days where I could keep the motorbike battery charged.,,

The top photo is taken with a 135mm Canon FD lens. The rest, are taken with the RX1. I could definitely get by with just the RX1 as my camera. Especially as mobile phones now routinely adorn 3 lenses; wide, normal, telephoto. I’ll keep my larger gear for now, but gone are the daily shooting escapades of life in Tokyo.

When it’s raining, I am unlikely to go out on the bike. I don’t have full waterproofs, and I ride the bike for fun, not as a chore. It’s not a tool, in that sense. It doesn’t get me to work. Therefore, I can ride it mostly in the dry, but as winter sets in, those days are seemingly limited.

That’s where life can change with a car. I also own a car, for fun (it’s an Aston Martin, in case you wondered), and took it out for a spin the other day even though it was spitting with rain most of the time. I was cosseted by heated leather seats, so it was the perfect place to be on a damp autumn day.

I’ll have a whole review/post on the car, including modifications etc, much as I did with [my bike](/reviewsandgear).

My brother recently picked up a Pixel 4. I’ve not got around to reviewing the P30 Pro yet, as I promised I would, but the truth of the matter is that though the camera is good, and you can get some really nice shots with it, it’s a bit clunky on the software side. This limits its enjoyment, much how people lambast camera makers such as Sony for overly complicated devices, compared with a Nikon from 1980. This is, I like my Sonys. I do not like the Huawei experience. I take more photos with my extremely old iPhone 7 than with the P30 Pro, and the output of the former is consistently higher than that of the latter. I am tempted by the iPhone 11 Pro, but at over 1000 Euros, I have to be more than tempted. That’s a hell of an outlay. Maybe all I need is a new battery in my iPhone 7?

I believe this shot, and the one above it, are taken with the Zeiss Pancolar 80mm F1.8. This is a rare and special lens. The command a premium online, and are optically excellent.

We’ve reached the end of the post with no big conclusion, but that’s OK.

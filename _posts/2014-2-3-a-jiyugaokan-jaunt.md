I've shown photos from _Jiyugaoka_ [numerous times](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/?tag=jiyugaoka). It's a lovely place in central Tokyo, and is definitely worth a visit.

I'm back into the working week, but I'll try to find inspiration in the dark streets of Tokyo on my way home. There's usually not enough time, or space, to be taking photos during the morning commute, but there's a first time for everything!

The now infamous _Honshu Blizzard of 2014_ was responsible for umpteen tonnes of snow dumped across Tokyo and regions beyond. We decided to lay low, and stay indoors (except when we went to get dinner). The following morning, we were greeted with a sky of brilliant blue, and a ground of bright white.

One thing I remembered from [snowfalls past](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/01/14/what-a-difference-a-day-makes) - though it seems the media forgets that it's ever snowed in Tokyo - is that the Japanese really go above and beyond the clean-up effort. The streets are always pretty clean in Japan - something which is still surprising in Tokyo given its size, but people like to keep their surrounding area nice and tidy. I lost count of the number of people shovelling snow. This doesn't happen back home in the UK. In the UK, grit is deposited onto the road surfaces (a pointless effort, given such snowfall), and then people will complain when there's lots of snow and ice remaining. Others will be smug, in their off-road or SUV. In Japan, it's quite different...

Looking up, we were greeted with glorious blues...

We decided to go for a long walk. Wearing my arctic gear (but with a camera instead of [the gun](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/about/)), it turned into a bit of a **yomp** through the snow. It was interesting how different the areas we frequent looked, under a cover of white.

> _**→　"Yomp"** is British [Royal Marines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines) [slang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) describing a long-distance march carrying full kit._

Though the temperature was below freezing for most of the weekend, it's around this time of year when the plum (it's technically apricot) and cherry trees to start blossom in Tokyo. It was a little surprising finding these dainty little blossoms amongst the snow.

I used my polarising filter all day, and it really made a difference. The blues of the sky are more pronounced, and some details were retained in the super-white snow.

After walking through the snow for many hours we were rather tired, and settled down with a nice big bowl of _spicy wonton noodles_ (incidentally, they are pronounced _wantan_ in Japan), before getting the train home.

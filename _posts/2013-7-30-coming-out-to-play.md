Over 40% of my photolibrary this year was captured using the Zeiss 24/1.8 for Sony E-mount (which translates to a focal length of 35mm on a camera with a "full-frame" sensor). Personally, I felt that figure should have been more like 95% - but if I look back at "keepers" rather than total shots, the figure is closer to 80%.

I liked the Zeiss rendering. I liked the _bokeh_  afforded by f/1.8. I liked the 35mm (equivalent) field of view. There wasn't much not to like. In fact, I think it's the best lens for the NEX system. I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.

I sold the lens on Sunday afternoon. Why? Well, this post marks the start of photos taken with my new camera, the Sony RX1. The Sony DSC-RX1 is a camera with a "full frame" sensor, and a fixed length 35mm Zeiss lens, in an ultraportable package. It's far smaller than the NEX-7, and that's saying something. I'm learning all about the camera, but managed to get away at lunch time to the nearby lake, and saw this e_xuvia_ attached to a nearby tree. The cicadas are deafening now. Like me with my new camera, they're all _coming out to play_.

Full-summer is just around the corner. Once these evening storms abide, temperatures won't fall below 30°C until September...

I'm back in Okinawa - this time for work - but rather than post uninspiring and dull photos of work (plus, this site is my hobby - to escape work!), I have a few photos from my lunch break at the very northern tip of Okinawa's main island. I spent a few minutes with my NEX-7 and manual lens chasing the amazing butterfly in the shot above...

It's quite odd being surrounded by such lushness and wildlife, when Christmas music is playing in convenience stores, in their full christmas decor.

I'll be here all week, but the weather forecast isn't so great. Who knows, though. Okinawa has crazy weather!

There's politics in the air. Local elections are taking place all over Tokyo, which means that there are numerous posters and political campaigners with loudspeakers (more on that another time).

This poster caught my eye. The Prime minister is looking upwards, in the usual "thoughtful" pose, but the forming storm-clouds overhead created a nice analogy. Is he considering what to do about the [ageing Japanese population](http://www.ibtimes.com/analysis-japanese-prime-minister-fails-account-japans-rapidly-aging-population-his-economic-reforms)? [Immigration](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2013/05/19/commentary/immigration-reform-could-this-be-abes-new-growth-strategy/)?  Or is he simply wondering which tie to wear next week?

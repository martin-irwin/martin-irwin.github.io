This post has been a long time coming. I'm currently in Japan for a week, on business, and haven't had time to look at photos or really take many at all. I planned on finishing up some lens reviews and the Vienna photos, but then some plonker drove into my car and I've had to deal with insurance and other stresses. Throw moving house into the equation and a blog post was the last thing on my mind!

But I did write a post. It's just that as I was about to press "publish", Squarespace crashed and I lost the entire thing. I have an open ticket with them about this situation, but to say that I was disappointed would be an understatement. So, the week before I came to Japan, was not great. Hopefully things will pick up upon my return. It's been good to escape the country and return to my second home, even if I am working very long hours with a lot of jetlag.

I'd basically written a review, of the _Carl Zeiss Jena Pancolar 80mm F1.8_ lens, which was used for all of the photos in this post. I've instead decided to waffle, and will tend to a review in the future at some point. Summary is that this lens is sharp and contrasty, is rare and thus expensive. I'd only recommend it to the lens _connoisseur_.

Frequent readers will note that I have something of a penchant for wide-angle lenses, or at least, wider-angle photography. However, it's always nice to experiment with new angles, and 80mm is quite a rare field-of-view, offering something different to the typical 50mm normal and 90mm short-tele ranges. I still have a few more photos from Vienna, so I hope you're not bored yet! I'll then have a few from Japan, and possibly, one day, the UK...!

Further around from Amalfi, we found a secluded beach…

If you’d like to know where this beach is, you’ll have to let me know. I don’t want to publicise such things too much on the internet as it really is such a beautiful location I hope it can remain somewhat secluded. They are developing in the area, mind you, so my efforts might be short-lived.

The Huawei P30 Pro takes a mean photo. The wide angle camera is great to have on a phone, and Apple recently joined the trend with their latest iPhone 11 and Pro series. The Huawei boots the hell out of colours, though, so though it looks “fine” on Instagram, or impressive to people when they look at a photo on your phone screen, I find it “a bit much”. I have actually tuned things down a little in the above photo. Thoughts?

Most of the time on the beach was spent with my eyes closed, covered in sun cream.

Without light there is no photograph, for photography is the capturing of light. Luckily, at ~7am in Tokyo at this time of year, the light is probably some of the best anywhere in the world.

I'm not one for super-HDR looking type photographs, but I had to stop when crossing the road the other morning, because the entire street had 3 or 4 different light sources (direct sun, reflections, reflections of reflections) that gave the entire scene the most bizarre clarity I have seen in real life...

Only objects in the distance look fairly normal - everything else up close looks hyper-realistic, which is how it appeared at the time. A very surreal experience. The contrasty Zeiss optics will have accentuated this somewhat, no doubt, but I thought it was a scene worth sharing.

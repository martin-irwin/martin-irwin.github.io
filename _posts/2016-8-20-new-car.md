After weeks of looking, I've finally bought a new car. I'm not sure how many readers of my blog care about cars, but I most certainly do! And, just as with the house (in the background) and indeed anything I do, I'm pretty fussy and don't really settle until completely content.

The car is an LCI BMW E92 M3 V8. Those letters and numbers mean a few things to a few people. LCI is what BMW call their facelifted cars, so the car has newer iDrive (computer) and LED taillights. E92 is the moniker of the two door coupé variant, and V8 defines is the 4 litre 8-cylinder (hence V8) engine, which produces over 100 hp per litre and redlines at 9000 rpm. Picture below, from the owners handbook.

My brother visited me this weekend, so we spent quality time with him and his girlfriend and their lovely dog.

Though windy, the sun was out and we went on a nice long walk. I often take my camera with me when we do this walk, but I don't want to get repetitive with my photography so I don't tend to shoot the same photos often if I can avoid it. 

I do know I have taken a few similar photos to the one below of the local church, but with the barley in full swing, the late-summer atmosphere was really captured in this frame:

My brother lives in Manchester, and so set off just after brunch. As the sun was out, I decided to take an on-loan Go Pro  Hero 3+ (video camera) on a bit of a ride around the local area in my new car. Video isn't something I have a lot of experience with, so please bear with me! There's audio clicking, as the mount wasn't attached as best it could be, and the angle isn't great. I'll work something out, and would like the audio to come from the exhaust in the future...

Can't wait to drive to work in the morning :)

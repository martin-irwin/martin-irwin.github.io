I'm above average height. That's in UK terms. Here in Japan I'm so far above average, I can't easily find shirts, trousers, or shoes. As returning to the UK is both massively time consuming, and expensive, I have to "import" them from the UK when friends or family visit. These brogues have been on my wish-list for some time, but they aren't sold in Japan in my apparently abnormal shoe size.

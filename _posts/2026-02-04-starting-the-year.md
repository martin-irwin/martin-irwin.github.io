At the end of last year, we were back in Japan to attend the wedding of one of my best friends. Though I was working, we also managed to get away for a couple of days and go skiing in the Japanese alps, which was fantastic. Some 50-70cm of snowfall (we were there right at the beginning of the season, so we were pretty lucky) and the weather was quite good (though pretty foggy, it was great fun).

It was basically a 2-week trip and was sandwiched between other life events, so it kind of came and went.

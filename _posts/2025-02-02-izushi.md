Our random drive through the back roads of central Japan took us to Izushi, Hyogo prefecture.

> Izushi is a castle town popular for its nostalgic atmosphere of old Japan. The town has many interesting attractions, including the Izushi Castle Ruins, Samurai House Karoyashiki, and Eirakukan Kabuki Theater. There are also many local specialties such as Izushi Pottery, Yanagi-gori (willow craft), and Izushi Sara Soba noodles served on five small plates.

Turns out there is a really nice tourist website for Izushi, [here](https://visitkinosaki.com/in-the-area/izushi/). They have one of the oldest Kabuki theaters in all of Japan, and a temple dating back to 1392.

We had Soba for lunch (that was all there is, with over 50 restaurants for Soba), and Izushi-style is to serve the soba on 5 small plates. One is supposed to eat the first plate just with dashi to taste first the soba flavor, and then add the condiments for the next plates. Then, the raw egg in the dashi and mix it before eating the last plate.

We then hiked up the “samurai trail” up to the top of the nearest mountain, past multiple warning signs for bears, and took in a timeless view before sunset.

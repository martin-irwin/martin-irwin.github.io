Cherry Blossom viewing, or hanami, is a popular pastime in Japan each spring. Though we were excited for our first, we're now on our third! Originally, we wondered why on earth the Japanese seem to treat each "sakura season" as if it were the first one. They never tire of it. Now we're starting our third, we know why.

The hanami (lit. flower see) season is characterised by the impressive blossom of the Japanese Cherry Blossom, _sakura sakura_. People gather underneath these fruitless cherry trees, and have drinking parties, always with cameras nearby.

This particular sakura season has snuck up on us. Only the other day, I [was saying](https://martin-irwin.squarespace.com/martin-irwin-photography/2013/03/10/quality-not-quantity) how the [ume blossom](https://martin-irwin.squarespace.com/martin-irwin-photography/2013/02/24/ume) were still not quite at their peak, yet here we are, scrambling to find a space in the park!

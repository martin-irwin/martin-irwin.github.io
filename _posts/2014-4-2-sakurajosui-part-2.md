In [Part 1](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2014/4/1/sakurajosui-pt-1), I took you for a brief tour around our residential area, focussed on the currently blooming cherry blossoms.

In this piece, I'll take you a little further (i.e. I visited different shops), towards the neighbouring neighbourhood of _Kamikitazawa_.

I bumped into a fellow Sony camera user, with his A7R and a hard carry case containing around 10 lenses. He was in the process of changing to what I believed to be the C/Y mount 50/1.4, when he flashed me a smile and said "have a good one!

_Kamikitazawa_ is a stone's throw from our apartment, and its famous for the sakura-lined streets at this time of year.

Even the local bakery closed shop for a few minutes to take a photo with some loyal customers.

More rain is forecast for tomorrow, but we're hoping that most of the sakura can stick around until at least Saturday. If they do, it'll be one busy day...

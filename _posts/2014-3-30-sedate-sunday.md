Today was, as predicted, a complete wash-out. I woke up at around 12:30pm, which is even later _for me_. I'm recovering from a flu, or cold, or something rotten. We decided to take it easy and just have a day at home - which is not something we do very often. Luckily, I have a few shots left over from last week which I'd like to share. Enjoy!

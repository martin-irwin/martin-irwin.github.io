_Tōfukuji_ (東福寺) is a large Zen temple in southeastern Kyoto that is particularly famous for the colours of its autumn foliage, though many trees have red leaves all-year round.

Several parts of _Tofukuji's_ temple grounds are free to enter, but we paid a small charge (¥400) to enter the large gardens.

_Tofukuji_ has historically been one of the principal Zen temples in Kyoto, and is a head temple of one of the schools of the _Rinzai_ sect of Zen Buddhism.

The 22-metre tall _Sanmon_ Gate (above) is the oldest Zen gate of its kind, dating back to 1425. 

We got off the train at _Tofukuji_ station, walked around _Tofukuji_, and then walked to _[Fushimi-Inari](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2014/5/21/fushimi-inari)_. The next day, we headed back to Tokyo.

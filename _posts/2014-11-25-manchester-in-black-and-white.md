Sometimes the weather is just against you, no matter what. I lived in Manchester for a number of years, and basically lived by that phrase. There's just nothing you can do; it's overcast, or raining, yet you have to get on with things. Luckily, there was a break in the rain, so I took my camera with me on my way to see [_Interstellar_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/) at the IMAX.

I stopped using zooms a while ago, in a subconscious pursuit of using the best optics possible. Though I enjoy using the RX100 with its great, compact zoom, you can't beat a prime. A single focal length attached to a camera makes you work harder for the picture. One can \[still\] be lazy, but you'll have to physically move to remove unwanted objects from your image.

Recently, I've become more and more interested in images with a wider field of view than is given with standard lenses (i.e. 50mm and 35mm). The thing is, the wider one goes, the more careful one has to be. There will be more objects in the frame, and so the _reduction game_ becomes a little harder (I talk about this a little more in "[_Wide Eyes_](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/wide-eyes)"—i.e. that wider angles are for perspective changes and not to "get more in").

So, I picked up a Vivitar 24mm f2.8 MC lens in Canon FD mount for a nominal fee (you can spend as much in one Starbucks hit), and got shooting. I'll not review the lens here, but from my one day with it so far, I can say that the centre is pretty sharp, though nothing like any of my other lenses. The edges are not sharp with the lens wide open, but are acceptable stopped down. These shortcomings are only visible when looking at the 36 MP RAW file of the A7R—it eats lenses for breakfast!

At web-sizes, no-one will really notice. And, does sharpness really matter anyway? I don't think that any of my photos here would be any better with sharper optics—improvements to composition would be much more welcomed!

However, if you did land on this page looking for a lens review, you're in luck. [Click this link to see my take on the tiny Voigtländer Nokton Classic 35mm F1.4 MC](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/reviews/voigtlnder-nokton-classic-35mm-f14-review).

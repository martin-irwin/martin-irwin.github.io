The Hokkaido University Botanical Gardens (北海道大学植物園, Hokkaidō Daigaku Shokubutsuen, 13.3 hectares) are [botanical gardens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botanical_garden "Botanical garden") operated by [Hokkaido University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_University "Hokkaido University"). They are located at North 3, West 8, [Chūō-ku](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D-ku,_Sapporo "Chūō-ku, Sapporo"),[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_University_Botanical_Gardens#cite_note-1) [Sapporo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapporo "Sapporo"), [Hokkaidō](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D "Hokkaidō"), [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan"), and open daily; a small admission fee is charged.

The gardens were established in 1886 as part of the Old Sapporo Agricultural College, and are now the second oldest botanical gardens in Japan (after [Koishikawa Botanical Garden](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koishikawa_Botanical_Garden "Koishikawa Botanical Garden")). Today they form part of the university's School of Agriculture, and contain a small part of the forest formerly covering the Ishikari Plain, plus collections of over 4,000 plant [species](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), including [alpine plants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_plant "Alpine plant"), wild plants from [Hokkaidō](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D "Hokkaidō"), and the oldest [lilac](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac "Lilac") in Sapporo. Serious [typhoon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon "Typhoon") damage was sustained in 2004.

The gardens also contain early [Hokkaidō](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaid%C5%8D "Hokkaidō") homes, a tropical [greenhouse](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse "Greenhouse"), and the Natural History Museum (built 1884), which exhibits [Ainu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people "Ainu people") artefacts, local archaeological and biological specimens, and the stuffed body of Taro, one of two surviving [sled dogs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled_dog "Sled dog") from Japan's 1958 [Antarctica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") mission.

We had a nice morning walk around the gardens, and would highly recommend a visit if you’re in Sapporo for a few days.

I may yet venture out on the motorbike today, but just in case, here are photos from the end of the week. The weather has turned into “Spring” finally, although really it’s more hinting of summer with a high of 23ºC today.

Yesterday was a write-off for me, as I was bed-ridden suffering from a reaction like no other due to the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine I was administered late on Thursday evening.

So, I am playing catch-up a little today. If I go out on the (newly serviced) motorbike, I’ll take my camera with me. Sometimes though, I am having too much fun riding to stop and take pictures, but let’s see.

Images take with a 135mm F2.0 Canon FD lens which I got for a few quid some years ago. Optically it’s superb. Would be great to be lighter, have stabilisation and autofocus, but then it would have cost me about a grand.

I quite like using it, and enjoy telephoto as much as wide angle. Possibly more enjoyable sniping from the apartment like this, zooming in on the details.

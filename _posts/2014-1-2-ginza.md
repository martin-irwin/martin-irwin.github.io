I wanted to share a few photos I took whilst in Ginza, a rather up-market district in Tokyo.

It's a great place for car and people watching - it's _the_ place to be if you like high prices and designer labels.

Remember to look up whilst walking around Ginza, and you'll be in for a treat - some of Tokyo's most interesting modern buildings are in Ginza.

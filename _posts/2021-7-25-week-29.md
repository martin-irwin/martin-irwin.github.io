Not a huge amount to say, so I will let the photos do the talking. It’s been raining a lot here, and that doesn’t seem to be changing any time soon. It’s rained so much, that the flow of the Rhein is too large to accommodate the regatta I’ve spent the last 8 months training for. It was cancelled, and cancelled last year due to the pandemic.

I’m in a rowing club, but I hardly row. Perhaps I need a different hobby.

The whole front of our building is covered in scaffolding, and there’s going to be some very noisy work over the next weeks due to some kind of balcony cleaning/renovation. I have no idea what is happening. It’s almost impossible to work from home, mind you, so I will need to figure something out.

If travel to Japan (for non-olympians) opens up any time soon (i.e. no quarantine), I’ll be booking a flight as soon as possible. It’s been too long, and I had itchy feet last January, let alone July 2021.

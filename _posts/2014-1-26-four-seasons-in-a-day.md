Every time I've visited _Echizen Province_ 「越前国」there's been some kind of precipitation. The region is fairly central to the main island of _Honshu_, north of _Kyoto_. There are no bullet trains going directly to the area, so one must change first at _Maibara_ 「米原駅」to a more local train.

Due to the rather extreme topography of the region, there's something of a microclimate in _Fukui_. The mountains separate the land into different blocks, which may have their own weather system at any given moment. This made for a rather adventurous voyage from central _Fukui_ to the coast at _Cape Echizen 「越前岬」_,  our final destination.

After collecting the hire car, we decided to escape the central city area with its generic eateries, and take our chances finding something more "local" and hopefully a little more authentic. We were in luck. We found an interesting looking _Soba_ place - an extremely old building covered in melting snow.

After wolfing down our soba noodles, we hit the road. Cutting through the narrow mountain roads, covered in snow, was really very good practice for my drifting, erm... I mean driving, skills.

We experienced hail, snow, rain... and clear blue skies on our journey to the coast.

At our highest elevation, the view was quite magnificent.

We had driven over an hour from Fukui city, and only had to cross one final mountain before reaching the our goal...

I'd say that Kanazawa is not a famous place. I'd never heard of it before moving to Japan, but that's just a case of Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, et al. stealing the limelight.

One place I wanted to visit in Kanazawa was the "21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art" or [金沢21世紀美術館](https://www.kanazawa21.jp/) in Japanese. I first learned of this place years ago, after seeing some photos in a photobook in an art gallery somewhere. Long before I knew "_konnichiwa_".

I would say there's something for everyone here, but I am not sure that's the case. A lot of people might simply say "what's the point?" for a lot of these types of exhibitions, but I suppose that's art. What's the point in any of it? What's the point of my blog? What's the point of your existence? To measure clouds?

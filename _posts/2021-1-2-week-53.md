I’ve decided to post at least a photo per week, in an attempt to a) use my cameras, b) use and justify the website, c) do something else in this “covid world”. We are not yet in a post-covid world, but we are in a transitional phase, a point in history more poignant than 9/11. The virus has made its way to every nook and cranny throughout the planet, crippling medical services, economies, and general mental health. No matter your views, this situation has an impact on you.

So, after coming back from one of the only permitted shops to be presently open, the supermarket, with some fruit, I thought I would photograph it.

I’ve started this journey in 2021, but this is technically Week 53 of 2020, the year that kept giving.

My plan is from now on to post photos once per week—they may not be coherent or themed, or linked in any way, other than I will have taken them that week.

Keep healthy, physically and mentally.

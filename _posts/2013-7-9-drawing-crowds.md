Rather a short post, but I wanted to share what I saw tonight as I walked through Shinjuku station in Tokyo. There were easily 100+ women of all ages, taking photos of what was apparently just an advert featuring five boys (men?). I have no idea of whom this quintet comprises, but it's one of those scenes I'll never forget.

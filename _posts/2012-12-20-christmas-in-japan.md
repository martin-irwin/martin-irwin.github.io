_Christmas in Japan │ NEX-7 & Voigtlander Nokton Classic 35mm F1.4 │ 35mm, ISO 100, f/1.4, 1/40_ Christmas is less than a week away! We moved here in January 2011, and so we've been here in Tokyo for almost two years. We originally planned to stay here for a year, but we've enjoyed it so much, that we are still here...

Christmas in Japan is an interesting affair, for a number of reasons. Firstly, I simply did not expect anything at all here. We're on an island the other side of the world, and after pretty far from America. I knew that New Year was the big celebration in Japan, and that Christmas Day itself is a day just like any other - most people will be at work. What I hadn't considered, was that the huge consumerist country that is Japan, has more Christmas illuminations, gifts and general themed events that I have seen during my entire life in the UK.

I've managed to negotiate a day off on Christmas Day (sounds rather Dickensian, to a Brit), but the rest of Japan will continue as normal. This means we will actually be able to go into shops, restaurants, cinema... but the first part of the day will be spent opening presents, which have been lovingly and painstakingly sent from the UK!

It's beginning to feel a lot like Christmas :)

Merry Christmas to all!

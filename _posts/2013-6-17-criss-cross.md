I went for a stroll on Saturday afternoon during a break in the near-constant rain. I was meeting friends for drinks in Ginza, and thought I'd walk there from Asakusa-bashi, as I fancied a walk by the river.

The contrast of the hatchings on the wall with the round wave-like patterns on the ground, caught my attention. Through my polarised sunglasses, the scene was similar to that above - devoid of any colour.

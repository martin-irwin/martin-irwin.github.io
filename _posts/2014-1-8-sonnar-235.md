It's raining a lot here in Tokyo (and Kyoto, apparently - you know who you are!), and so I decided to take a quick macro shot of my DSC-RX1.

> The Zeiss Sonnar is a photographic lens originally designed by Dr. Ludwig Bertele in 1929 and patented by Zeiss Ikon. It was notable for its relatively light weight, simple design and fast aperture.

It's an amazing lens, and sensor, and I am not sure why I would ever part with it. As point and shoot cameras go, I don't think there is a better one than this. It's arguably Sony's best ever camera.

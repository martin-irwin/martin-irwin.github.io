It’s rare to see someone being winched up to a helicopter from your apartment winder, then being flown to the nearby hospital. Whatever happened, it must have been determined that a road ambulance was not useful. Could be something on top of a building, I suppose, but could just as likely be down at the railway tracks. I hope their story had a happy ending.

I’ve taken a few motorbike rides in the black forest recently, and then before I know it, it’s time to do the blog post and I feel somewhat lacking in content! At least there’s a steady trickle, even if it’s not quite the photographic tour-de-force I wanted, but we are not yet half way through the year.

If you’re after book recommendations, I just finished reading _Erebus: The Story of a Ship_ by Michael Palin. A relatively well known story for Brits and Canadians alike, I won’t go into any spoilers here, but it was an exciting and gripping read from cover to cover.

I think I’ll get a lot of reading done this summer.

_Roppongi Hills Christmas Market │ NEX-7 & Voigtlander Nokton Classic 35mm F1.4 │ 35mm, ISO 640, f/1.4, 1/60_ Brätwurst and mulled wine were consumed enthusiastically at the German Christmas market here in Roppongi. Great atmosphere, and the hot sausage, mustard and mulled wine, went down a treat.

Merry Christmas to all!

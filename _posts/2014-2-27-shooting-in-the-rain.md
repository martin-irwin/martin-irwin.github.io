When it's raining like this in central Tokyo, I can't help but think of [_Blade Runner_](http://bladerunnerthemovie.warnerbros.com/)...

Today was another smoggy day, but this rain is helping to remove some of the particles from air, which should freshen things up. We haven't had rain for a while - it's mainly been snow. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed walking around in the rain so much...

Though my lens is actually "weather sealed", my camera isn't. A long lens hood kept the rain off the front element, and I made sure my camera was safe under my umbrella.

I almost always think of [_Blade Runner_](http://bladerunnerthemovie.warnerbros.com/) when it's raining in Tokyo. It's hard not to. The neons with _kana_, skyscrapers, and  sheer volume of people make you feel as if you're on set.

This rain will pretty much remove all traces of snow from the streets of Tokyo. I'm doubtful that snow will return, but it may do. Personally, I have a feeling that this upcoming wet week marks a change in air mass - Tokyo will warm a little, the vegetation will come out of its slumber, and the nights will get longer.

I think I'm ready for Spring...

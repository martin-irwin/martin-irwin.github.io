Central Tokyo is just starting to turn. The trees are turning an amazing mix of red, yellow, and green. It's a beautiful time of year, and it seems such a shame to have to work in an office during daylight hours so bright and vivid as this.

In around a week, autumn will be all around us. The above tree, central to the campus here at the University of Tokyo, turns an amazing yellow by the end of the year. I estimate that in the first week of december, this area of the campus will be yellow, if [previous years are anything to go by](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2012/12/08/it-was-all-yellow/).

However, next week, I'll be in Okinawa for work - when I return I think it'll be impossible to walk around Tokyo without rustling in leaves!

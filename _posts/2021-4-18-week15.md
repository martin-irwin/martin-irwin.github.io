Sub 10ÂºC here, after the promise of higher spring temperatures and cherry blossoms, we are back to ice cold winds, snow, and rowing on an extremely cold Rhein.

To that end, once I made it hope from rowing yesterday morning, I remained indoors. We assembled various IKEA pieces scattered across the apartment, including the installation of two of the lamps above, for the living room.

These ended up being just a few quick snaps, and in order to meet the self-imposed deadline of today for the post, I will post today. However, I would take the photos slightly differently if I were doing it again (perhaps I will), but in order to do so, the Sun must have set.

Have a good start to your week.

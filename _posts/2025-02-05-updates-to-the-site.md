title: Updates to the site
excerpt: “After years of using Squarespace, I finally made the switch to Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The reasons? Clunky editing, restrictive workflows, poor mobile apps, and rising costs. Now, my site is fully in my control, backed up locally and on GitHub, with a seamless blogging workflow. I’ve also restored comments and embraced a more open, personal web—something that feels increasingly rare in today’s internet. Oh, and I’m playing Cyberpunk 2077, which ties into all this more than you’d think…”

You can spend hours creating a great theme, then go to post, and it takes literally 10x longer than it should do, because there’s nothing other than the GUI approach to posting. In theory this is OK, but image blocks have to be manually inserted before images can be threaded into the main body. This means I cannot simply write text and drag and drop an image into it. I have to write a specific *block* of text, and then insert an image block, then upload the image into the block, and then get writing again. It’s not a disaster, but it just became too frustrating to use. You can actually insert blocks into walls of text, but it’s clunky and unpredictable. If the site crashes or reloads whilst you’re doing this, you will lose the post entirely. So, that makes you write a draft somewhere else first, and if you include images into that draft, then the Squarespace workflow really becomes a lengthy burden. 

There are three other reasons I have abandoned Squarespace:
1) The photos I take are mine, and I am happy for them to be online for all to see. There was a time when I first started, when I was worried about copyright and people “stealing my images”. In short, those that wish to use my images for non-commercial purposes are free to do so, and if you want to make money using my images, you’re supposed to then pay me something. This is a model that generally works, so I removed watermarks and stopped caring about it too much. The bigger issue, is that I upload the images to Squarespace, and then also kept a local copy on my computer “for me”. Squarespace is not friendly when it comes to getting your data back, which is something I will get to later. But in a nutshell, I didn’t like being locked into a specific platform.
2) The mobile apps are terrible. I have the luxury of presently writing this post on the 13” iPad Pro M4. It’s technically the most powerful computer I own, even though it is somewhat crippled by iOS. Writing posts on the app is even more frustrating than writing them on my computer through a web interface. The app is clunky and crashes, and everything just takes ages to do. If you know absolutely nothing about code, or computers, it might be passable—if you have ever used Wordpress it will feel like a downgrade. The App Store review “speaks for itself” although somehow it has 4.6/5, yet a cursory glance at the reviews themselves reveal the true story.

3) Price. When I first started the site, it was around $80 USD for the year of hosting, and the site has fantastic uptime. My plan remained exactly the same in terms of services (they added features I did not want, such as e-commerce), but ballooned up to $198/year. This is quite a chunk, taking the total cost of the site to over $20/month when I include the domain name license. Considering I didn’t use the site much in the last couple of years, this grated a little too much and I decided to call it a day. I exported the site, and disabled auto-renew.

I spent a while looking for alternatives, and discovered that websites can be natively hosted on GitHub, if you’re prepared to do the work. This fits me much better, as I love to play around with computer code and basic web stuff like HTML and CSS. I won’t write about how I did all of this here as it’s probably not that useful considering all the expert guides out there, but this is what I did:

- export Squarespace site in Wordpress format
- Uploaded site into Wordpress
- Exported from Wordpress into “markdown” format
- Rebuilt the whole site using Jekyll, and redeployed all my old blog posts going back to 2013, images included

So now, I have all the images locally, and in fact, backed up to GitHub. GitHub is likely to be around for a while, and even if they started charging, no big problem as I have everything in a more “open source” format from which I can deploy my website anywhere.

Most recently, I added comments back to the site, so feel free to comment using the Disqus format. I have some regular readers that do comment, and for me it’s worth hearing from them at the expense of my managing spam. Speaking of spam, another reason I want to blog like it’s 2013 is because I am real and not a bot; I help to counter the *Dead Internet Theory*;

> The **dead Internet theory** is an online [conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory) that asserts, due to a coordinated and intentional effort, the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) since 2016 or 2017 has consisted mainly of [bot activity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) and [automatically generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_generated_content) manipulated by [algorithmic curation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_curation) to control the population and minimize organic human activity.[1][2][3][4][5] Proponents of the theory believe these [social bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bot) were created intentionally to help manipulate algorithms and boost search results in order to manipulate consumers.[6][7] Some proponents of the theory accuse government agencies of using bots to manipulate public perception.[2][6] The dead Internet theory has gained traction because many of the observed phenomena are quantifiable, such as increased bot traffic, but the literature on the subject does not support the full theory.[2][4][8]

SEO has definitely killed what was the “beauty” of the early internet (I don’t necessarily mean an aesthetic beauty, but more a simplicity and pureness)—good luck looking for a recipe for something online unless you want to learn about the history of its ingredients. Likewise, YouTube has changed hugely since I first used it. Things always change, but YouTube was a place for people to put their videos. Hence *YouTube*. However, the production quality of many things on YouTube now rivals that of the peak BBC. Which on one hand is great, and on another is disheartening. It’s the reason I have hardly used my own account in the last decade. Someone else always does it better. But do they really? I take photos because it’s what I see, and likewise, if I were to make a video on a certain topic it will be my own take on said topic. No-one else can provide Martin’s take. Wikipedia is the default-go to for backing up opinions or “facts” now replacing the simple Google Search, and ChatGPT is going to take this to even higher levels. I could go on with this topic *ad infinatum* but I’ll spare you the reading time.  I’m not alone in this view, far from it. A [whole movement](https://yesterweb.org) was created on the premise that the corporate-driven internet dominated by social media and centralized platforms. It advocated for a return to the more personal, creative, and decentralized web of the early internet era (something which in general I can agree with). From glancing at that absolutely massive document and reading this witty summary [here](https://suboptimalism.neocities.org/writings/yesterweb), it looks like it all fell apart as these things often do. 

### Cyberpunk

On a related note, I am playing Cyberpunk 2077 at present and find it to be one of the best games I’ve ever played. I am around 35% complete according to the PlayStation, but I don’t even want the main missions to end! It’s so immersive to play, and the script and overall premise is right up my street. It’s Ghost in the Shell meets Terminator, Robocop, and Blade Runner. You can read all about it elsewhere, but I mention it here as in that future, mega corporations (*corps*) such as Arasaka 荒坂, Militech, Kang Tao, and others, rule the world. Its dystopia turned up to 11, and the “old internet” was destroyed in an event known as the DataKrash.

The Old Net (our internet) became unusable. The world was forced to create a new, more controlled version of the internet, known as the ***Blackwall-protected Net*** in Cyberpunk 2077. Governments and corps scrambled to rebuild their digital empires, but the damage was so severe that much of the old world’s information was permanently lost. I can see us going in such a direction. It’s also one of the best looking games I’ve ever played and has an epic soundtrack. 10/10.

## Blogging now

So my blog workflow, literally a workflow using the Shortcuts app on iOS, is to write the blog in Bear, drag and drop the images to where I want them, hit “Share” *et voila*, the post is published (well, actually it is pushed to the fantastic [Working Copy Git client](https://workingcopy.app) and from there committed and pushed) . This is near to the exact opposite in feeling compared to the Squarespace way of doing things (not a workflow at all), so I’m really pleased I’ve put this together.

Squarespace requires an internet connection in order to be writing a blog post. I could draft it elsewhere of course, but that’s all a bit too convoluted. The iPad even has a 5G eSIM connection, but if there’s patchy net connection you lose the whole post. Far too frustrating. So instead, I work essentially offline then press publish when I’m done.

Let me know if you would like a copy of the workflow.

I would argue that there are two zoos in Ueno; the official Ueno Zoo, and downtown Ueno. Downtown Ueno is home to one of the more "seedy" \[みすぼらしい\] areas in Tokyo, with questionable stores and _love hotels_ in abundance. However, it's a pretty interesting area to walk around, especially as a foreigner. I'm either ignored by touts, or they'll ask me in English (sometimes Japanese) if I would like to visit their establishment (whatever it may be). "結構です。"（I'm OK thanks!）

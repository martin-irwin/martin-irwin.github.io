As the world deals with the Covid-19 outbreak, we’re seeing how each country responds. in turn. Media spotlights are pointed at Governments, with strategies linked to “low deaths” receiving praise, and perhaps some criticism along the lines of “we overreacted”. Others face criticism for halting almost all other medical procedures to “deal with the C19 crisis”, hello UK, and others have gun-wielding protesters storming Government buildings, demanding an end to lockdown (hello USA).

Home office has become the norm, and only a few places permit civilians to partake in outdoor exercise. Thankfully, there’s no such law against carrying a camera with you, when you’re out for a walk. Yet.

There’s not really much I have to say that hasn’t been said a thousand times all over the internet. I can only give an opinion related to my own personal circumstance. The general outlook is pretty grim, if I think about it, but it could be much worse.

 Mostly, I am simply living in the moment, as that’s all we can do anyway.

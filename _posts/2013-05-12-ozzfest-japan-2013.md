Music is a funny thing. It polarises people. Lasers are also [polarised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster's_angle). I like music, and I like lasers. When one of my favourite bands uses lasers. I'm happy.

We went on **Day 2** (today). Our ears are still ringing. The only thing abating the ringing is to play some _more_ music! I was pretty blown away by the performance of [_Stone Sour_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Sour), surprisingly. I thought they'd be pretty good, but now I'm looking through their back catalogue on iTunes. Tool were just as they are every time I see them; impeccable - a flawless performance. Next up were the headliners; [Black Sabbath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sabbath). Amazing!

Their average age is 63. Being British, they'll be entitled to a free buss pass soon (the qualifying age used to be 60, but was pushed back to 65). Anyway, I won't lie and say that Ozzy looked young, or full of life, but he was certainly impressive. Forming a band in 1968, and playing a headlining gig under your own name **45 years later** is incredible. They sounded very good, too. Well done chaps.

The coastline around Fukui-prefecture is characterised by jagged metamorphic rock ([of which I took a photo last year](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2012/10/22/tojinbo)), and the vast expanse of the Sea of Japan (日本海). Though it was actually raining (I think it is always raining in Fukui) quite hard, the sun was also shining quite brilliantly through the clouds, giving the sea an amazing blue. I stopped the car half-way up the mountain road, and took this snap.

_Bubbles | NEX-C3 & SEL30F35 Macro | 30mm, 1/4s, f/9, JPEG_

Well, I've not posted for a while. Unfortuantely, it's not because I've been too busy taking photos. We had a 4-day weekend as part of the latter half of "[Golden Week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_(Japan))", but I spent the first 3 days with a fever, stuck inside the apartment, mostly in bed. I took the camera with me on the one day I made it out, and I just didn't see anything/feel inspired in any way.

I'm still not 100%, but I'm well enough to make it to work, and well enough to start fiddling around with cameras. My NEX-7 is with Sony, but I'll explain more on that another time. It's time to have some fun with the C3, and remind myself why I got into the entire NEX system in the first place!

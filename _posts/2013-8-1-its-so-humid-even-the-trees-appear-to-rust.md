I am always appreciative of trees being left alone in construction sites, or even in completed areas. This seems to happen more in Japan than back home in the UK. On a few occasions, I've seen walls, fences, and even roofs, with holes or recesses where an old tree's been left to its own devices. This particular tree caught my eye as it seems to have sympathy for the metal fence in the foreground, mimicking rust on its bark.

Firstly, I'd like to apologise to anyone receiving a huge amount of emails from my site over the last week. I've had a problem with Wordpress plugins, which resulted in my site's server actually being _shut down_ numerous times. Totally suspended without any access; I'm currently looking at my options to avoid this in the future. Part of my plan involves changing server, and completely changing the look of the site to a more modern theme. Stay tuned!  

I've never actually been to New York, but I've had New-York style foods all over the world. Bagels, cheesecakes, pies, coffee... a whole manner of tastiness can be found inside _Bubby's_. There's one in Yokohama (the one we went to) and one in central Tokyo. [Check them out](http://www.bubbys.com/our-restaurants/japan/) if you have time!

At this point, I'd like to recommend the excellent blog by _Alex Irmscher_ "[dybydy-phtgrphy](http://dybydy-phtgrphy.com/blog/)", as Alex has recently been to New York. Please checkout his excellent photos.

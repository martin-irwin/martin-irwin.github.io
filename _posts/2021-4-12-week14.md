I’m often asked “what camera do you use?”. Whilst there’s no denying that the image quality from my camera is good, sometimes I am asked this of a smartphone picture, or from a very old photo taken on film, etc etc. It’s a bit clichéd to say that the best camera you have is the one with you, or that cameras don’t matter, but there’s some truth in having a decent sensor for digital photography. Then, comes what I think is the bigger player here—the lens.

Lenses are interesting because on one hand they are simply the method to focus light onto the sensor; the camera and sensor and development are what make the resultant image, but on the other hand, no two lenses are the same. Even two of the same lens, will have physical differences, however small. This translates into their treatment of photons, and thus, the image.

Wider lenses are my favourite most of the time, 28mm and 35mm being my natural duo of go-to lenses for almost all of my photography. However, I have some ultra wide (down to 12mm) and telephoto (130mm) lenses in stock. I mostly have 50mm lenses though, as they’re the “standard lens” in many senses, and manual focus lenses from the 80s can be had for the price of a cup of coffee.

The Sony camera lineup is superbly versatile, but that comes at the expense of feeling like a digital system. Take LEICA cameras , for example. They’re really aimed at maintaining a very tactile and consistent design- and user-language throughout their range. Having said that, there’s a lot to be said for viewing these things as tools, to generate photos. That’s their purpose, after all. I understand arguments regarding ergonomics etc, but it’s rare to hit a home run in that department. One man’s ergonomic nightmare is another’s go-to every day carry.

I’ll end by saying that I essentially have “enough” lenses and cameras. I have stopped frequenting forums and chasing the latest and greatest, mostly down to money. I’ve decided to try and simply go back to when I just saved up for my first “proper camera” and try and improve on the photos I take. All of the gear in the world, sat in a drawer, is no match to someone taking 20 photos per day and honing their craft.

Our journey to _[Hamarikyu Gardens](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/hama-rikyu-onshi-teien),_ via _[Ginza](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/a-glimpse-of-ginza),_ started much farther north in _Kudanshita__._ We walked around the Eastern-wing of the Emperor's Palace, past all of the tourists and joggers, looking for something different.

Of course, it didn't take long. We're in Tokyo after all.

OK, enough with the weird dog photos. I've probably got enough for a "_Dogs of Japan_" photobook... now there's an idea!

Just to the southeast of the palace, is the fantastic statue of the 14th Century samurai; [_Kusunoki Masashige_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusunoki_Masashige).

The statue is really quite large.

I'll end this mini-series here. The majority of shots were taken at a focal length of ~50mm, which is actually rather new for me. It's a favourite focal length amongst photographers, but the switch from 35mm is taking more adjustment than when I use ~85mm lenses. I suppose because it's somewhere in between _wide_ and _tight_. It's not really wide at all, unlike 35mm. And it's not super-tight, so one has to work hard for the details. Composition is a challenge, but this is exactly what I want from my photography; **inspirational subjects**, and **challenges**.

And that's just as well - I have a few "fast 50s" to put through their paces in the coming weeks.

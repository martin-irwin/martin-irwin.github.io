_Tokyo Tower │ NEX-7 & Sigma 30mm F2.8 DN │ 30mm, ISO 800, f/2.8, 1/20, RAW_

Took this the other night, from the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building](/martin-irwin-photography/2013/01/18/winter-fuji "Winter Fuji") viewing deck, on the 45th storey, 202m up. This is quite a crop, as I didn't have anything tighter than the sigma with me, but I think it does Tokyo Tower justice.

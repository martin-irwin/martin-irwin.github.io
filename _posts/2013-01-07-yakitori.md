_Yakitori │ Samsung Galaxy Nexus; 5MP F2.6 │ 3.43mm, ISO 80, f/2.6, 1/92_ Yakitori 「焼き鳥」is the Japanese cuisine of grilled chicken. Though it doesn't sound like much, it's possibly one of my favourite meals. Our personal favourite, is the yakitori of the skewered variety; namely kushi-yaki 「串焼」as inscribed on the sign outside our favourite local restaurant.

I've certainly been known to take pictures of food, especially since moving to Japan. The presentation here, even for inexpensive dishes in casual restaurants, is often sublime. However, on this particular occasion, the [shochu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dch%C5%AB) & hot water flowed, and various skewered morsels devoured.

Food snaps another time ;)

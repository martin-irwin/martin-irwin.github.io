The Rhine Falls (German: Rheinfall) are the largest waterfalls in Europe. At 150 m wide and 23m tall, though huge up close,Â they are possibly most impressive from the train station on approach. Unfortunately, I wasn't quick enough with my camera, but I am sure I will visit again... perhaps when it's warmer!

I was in a very monochrome mood, and I felt the light of the day suited black and white very well, though there was some lovely greens and blues in certain parts of the deep, cold, water.

Presenting to you a few more landscape photos, but this time from the Swiss Alps. We took the motorbikes out for a spin, and enjoyed the excellent mountain passes with their stunning vistas. We have a few large prints of these roads printed and framed within the apartment. 

I’ve been meaning to keep up with blog posts, but I’ll keep this one relatively short. Things are busy at the moment, but in a good way.

In the back of my mind, I’ve been thinking about which lenses and gear to take on this year’s trip to Japan. The itinerary is Tokyo, Himeji, Okinawa, and then back to Tokyo. I’m leaning towards bringing the 20–70mm f/4 — a great all-rounder that’s not too heavy. I’m also tempted to bring some primes along to make things a bit more interesting. One option is my rarely used 15mm f/4.5 — Super Wide, as its namesake. Then there’s the Sony 28mm f/2, which is decent enough (though it doesn’t seem to get much love online), and possibly the 55mm f/1.8, which is both sharp and renders fantasticly.

35mm has long been my favourite focal length, but I’ve got the Voigtländer 40mm f/1.2, which I picked up last year. It’s a stunning lens. I could pair that with the 28mm — a more distinct combo than 28mm and 35mm, arguably. 24mm is another great focal length and would also pair nicely with either the 40mm or the 55mm…

Option 3(?) could be: to take 20–70mm, 15mm, 40mm, and then (maybe) picking up the lovely Sony 24mm prime…

Thoughts?

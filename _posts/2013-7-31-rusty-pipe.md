I'm still getting used to my new camera, so it's just as well that the weather is terrible at the moment, otherwise I'd be in danger of letting technology get in the way of art. This rusty pipe caught my eye when I left the office tonight. It was essentially twilight, but the low light was no match for the fast lens and high ISO of the RX1.

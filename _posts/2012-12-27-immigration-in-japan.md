_Immigration │ NEX-7 & SEL 30mm F3.5 Macro │ 30mm, ISO 1600, f/7.1, 1/40_ "Immigrant" is not a warm and fuzzy word. It separates people. Until one has lived as an immigrant somewhere, one cannot really understand this separation. Holidays abroad are completely different. Then you're a _tourist_. We have residential status, and pay taxes. I'm not sure if we could have voted in the latest election (possibly, with some difficulty), but it's rather academic all the same.

Shinagawa station is huge. Housing both regular lines and the bullet train terminal, this modern station is always busy. There's not too much in the local vicinity, other than government offices and the immigration bureau\* (no photo of that).

After submitting our application, we took a train to Ginza (a rather nice area in central Tokyo), for a bite to eat before sunset.

After sunset, we walked to Tokyo station, hoping to see the illuminations... only to find out that they've been [suspended due to large crowds](http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/huge-crowds-force-suspension-of-tokyo-station-light-up-event)... I'd have expected large crowds, personally. Anyway, the above photo is of Tokyo's central post office, which was one of the best looking and best-lit buildings around.

I've spent the last couple of days in [Fukui prefecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukui_Prefecture) (where this shot was taken), undertaking repairs for work. I'm pretty tired after hours of travelling following a long day of manual labour, but everything is working as it should, so I can sleep peacefully.

It's been 4 years since the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, and though we were relatively unaffected by the ordeal, it's something we will never forget. Our thoughts are often with those in the heavily affected areas; it's easy to forget that lives can be ruined through momentary acts of nature. We are now some 6000 miles from Tokyo, and earthquakes are not something to worry about in the UK; made evident by its architecture.

At the moment, we're busy looking for somewhere to live. This is not an easy game. It was hard enough in Tokyo, but here in the UK prices are high and housing is scarce. Photography offers some nice escapism, but though we were treated to glorious weather on Saturday, the weather over the last few days has been dull and a lot colder than expected. Spring is on the way, but it's not here yet.

This is around the time of year we would normally head to Ome just west of Tokyo ([exactly to the day, in fact](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2013/03/10/quality-not-quantity)), and be disappointed in the lack of plum blossoms during the "plum blossom festival". I don't even look for plum or cherry blossoms in the UK, as they're so rare to find. Luckily, Charlotte has something of a sixth sense for them, and regularly locates blossoms. Looking through the lens, I could have been back in Tokyo...

Spring is definitely on the way, which is no surprise, but it's most definitely welcomed.

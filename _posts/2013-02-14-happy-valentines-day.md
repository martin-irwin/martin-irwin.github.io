_Happy Valentine's Day │ NEX-7 & Canon nFD 50mm F1.4 │ 50mm, ISO 100, f/1.4, 1/125, RAW_

Valentine's Day, like any (commercially viable) celebration, is big-news in Japan. Here though, they do things a little differently.

Here in Japan, the tradition is for the girls to give the boys some chocolate on Valentine's Day, Feb 14th, don't complain yet, ladies... because on March 14th ("White Day") the boys are then supposed to give their beloved gift(s) 2 or 3 times the value!

Thank you, Charlotte ♡

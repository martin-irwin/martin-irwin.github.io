I agree with the above coffee advert - _blend is beautiful_. This sentiment is valid for certain aspects of photography, too. Often, it is desirable to have a very smooth blend of background blur, or _bokeh_ (the Japanese word for blur).

In the pursuit of the perfect blend, I've acquired Sony's latest FE-mount lens, the SEL55F18Z. As pointed out by friend and fellow photoblographer Björn Utpott ([his blog](http://bmupix.com/) is a source of daily inspiration), I have a lens with a similar focal length and aperture already - the Canon nFD 50mm F1.4.

Even though the weather today was completely overcast, I took both lenses with me on the way to the shops and performed something of a comparison.

This isn't a scientific test by any interpretation, but one thing is clear - the new FE 55/1,8 is very sharp wide open, and does not have any purple fringing, or suffer from [chromatic aberration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration) (CA). When the nFD lens is stopped down to f/4, the image is very sharp. The new Sony FE lens is sharper, but this may not matter to some. I would still recommend the nFD lens to those on a budget, or wanting to use manual focus glass... but I would recommend the new Sony FE 55/1,8 Zeiss lens over it... every time.

Incidentally, you may (or more likely, may not) have noticed a change to the homepage of this site. I hope you like it! I've also changed the "[reviews and gear](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/reviewsandgear/)"  section, listing my ramblings in reverse chronological order.

I hope that you enjoyed the photos, and found the (non-scientific) comparison interesting.

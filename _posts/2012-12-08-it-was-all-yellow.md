_It was all yellow... │_ __NEX-C3 & _SEL 16mm  F2.8_ │ 16mm, _ISO 200, f/5, 1/250___

Just before the leaves leave the trees, we are treated with some of the most vibrant yellows I've seen in nature. Yes, I did walk through the leaves, kicking them as if I were 10 years old. I hope you enjoy the snaps.

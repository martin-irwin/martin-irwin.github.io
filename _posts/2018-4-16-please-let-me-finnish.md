Finland is a funny place. There's a population of 5 million (that's Manchester and Birmingham combined), and a language that is like no other.

I decided to go for one 30 minute walk and almost died. I think it was -10ºC or something but I was suitably dressed (mini skirt, high heels, skimpy top/jk) and google maps was saying 25 minutes to my hotel. No problem. Except that my phone battery was depleting at faster than 1% per minute and had 50% left. My camera didn't fare much better. I took the photos you see here today before the never-before-seen "battery depleted" message popped up. Always fun to see something new.

My impression of Finland was thus: it's bloody cold.

Not sure I can say if it's worth visiting, as I didn't stay for long and only really saw a little bit of Helsinki. I am sure that if I had more time and more clothing I could have explored in far more detail. Until then, I'll Finnish here.

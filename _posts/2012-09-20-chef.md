I'd like to thank all of my friends for their kind words and support regarding this website. A lot of hard work and effort went into it; it's been on my todo list for at least three years now, since I let my iWeb account expire and just let my photolibrary gather digital dust on my hard drive.

As for the photo; it's a chef hard at work in a small restaurant in one of the millions of backstreets making up the web that is the metropolis known as Tokyo. Even if I were to live the rest of my life in Tokyo, I would not be able to eat at all of the restaurants here. There are that many. In fact, due to the sheer ubiquity of good food, one has to remember to in fact try new places, and not get into a comfy rut at the same old haunts.

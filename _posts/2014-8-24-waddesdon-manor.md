Finally, I "have the internet". It's taken a while—my most recent posts were actually composed on my phone, which is far from ideal—but now that I have the internet, I hope to get into more of a rhythm with the blog, and photography in general. Let's start off with a quick look at where we went today to meet friends for brunch; _Waddesdon Manor_ in Buckinghamshire.

There's little to do in the presence of such opulence as to be simply awestruck. The grounds of Waddeson Manor are as extensive as 200 acres would have you believe. There's even a shuttle-bus running from the car park to the front of the manor (though it must be said that many patrons are well over 60 years old).

> Waddesdon Manor is a country house in the village of Waddesdon, in Buckinghamshire. The house was built in the Neo-Renaissance style of a French château between 1874 and 1889 for Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild.

Though the building itself is spectacular, the surrounding grounds are well kept and house a variety of flora.

If you have a look at the map below, you'll see the stables to the northeast of the manor. They've been turned into a rather nice cafe & shop area, whilst remaining in keeping with the original aesthetic.

There's an aviary, but the birds were rather small and seemingly shy. I prefer to see birds in the wild, at any rate.

It's near-impossible to take photographs without wandering strangers in-frame in such places, but I gained  a little experience after almost 4 years in Tokyo!

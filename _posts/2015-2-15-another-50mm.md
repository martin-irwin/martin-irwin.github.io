Another weekend of dull weather (supremely foggy today), culminating in my lacking inspiration, which is a bit of a shame, as I have a couple of "new" optics (or should I say, O_ptiks_, hint hint) to try out. All is not lost, as I am off to Germany tomorrow for a couple of days, and will be taking a camera with me. I'm not sure if I should take my RX1 for minimal carriage, or the A7R and two lenses... (they are 28mm and 50mm, if that helps your reasoning)

I'm considering a few lens purchases for this year, with the FE 16-35 F4 high up on the list. It's supposed to be rather good, so we'll see. Saying that, the 28/2 looks promising, but then the range of 16-35mm is appealing. I've never had a wide-angle zoom, so it might be worth trying out...

One thing I am fairly certain of, is that I _will not_ be selling my A7R and getting a different body. Fuji make nice cameras, the M240 looks great, and the A7II has IBIS. Fuji "only" make APS-C, which is arguably all I need, but since I have purchased a full-frame camera, I feel like sticking to my guns. The M240 is the same price as a decent used car. I could get one, but I'm still not sure if the M-life is for me. And the A7II looks great, but there will be another update at some point. The lens game is cheaper, and those I've purchased and would consider selling have slightly risen in their eBay market values over the last few years, which is nice. That never happens with bodies...

Interestingly, the two newest lenses to my collection are 28mm and 50mm. With 35mm my favourite, this might seem like and odd purchase, but I am still trying to find some sweet wide angle lenses (the Voigtländer 21/1.8 is top of my list), and I do enjoy 50mm field-of-view and am slowly getting used to it. The new Sony 35mm F1.4 lens really has my interest. This could be an expensive year...

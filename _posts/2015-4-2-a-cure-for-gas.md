I've written about gear acquisition syndrome (GAS) [before](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2015/2/3/rinse-repeat), and I'm going to go one step further with this post. It's been a while since I've written a post, and that's for a few reasons. I've been busy with work, the weather has been mostly horrible (severe winds, lots of rain, and generally uninspiring), and busy weekends have left very little time to go anywhere and take photos. Yes, one can take photos at home, but the [orchid](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/2015/3/4/orchid) has died.

So what to do? How to cure this burning sensation in my pocket? Buy a new lens, that always gets the photo-mojo back, right? Or how about a nice new camera? A new toy to place with. Ooops, I meant, "another tool with which to create one's artistic vision". Hang on... I have two of those, and a bag of lenses. Hmm.

OK, I know the real cure for GAS. Get off eBay, and buy a plane ticket. That's what I did just before writing this article.

See you in a few days.

_I'm only taking the RX1 btw_

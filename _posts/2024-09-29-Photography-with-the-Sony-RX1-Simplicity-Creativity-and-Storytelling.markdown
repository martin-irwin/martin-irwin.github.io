I have had this camera 10 years now. There are better cameras on the market (and I want to buy one), but I brought with me the Sony RX1 for its simplicity and size. 

Carrying just one camera can evoke a sense of duality, presenting both limitations and freedoms for a photographer. On one hand, the restriction of using a single camera forces the individual to concentrate on mastering the equipment. This limitation cultivates a deeper understanding of its capabilities and nuances, ultimately enhancing the photographer’s skill set. The photographer learns to be resourceful and innovative, adapting to varying conditions with a singular tool. 

This streamlined approach can also liberate the creative process. When I walk around without the distraction of interchangeable gear, I am able to immerse myself fully in the moment, directing my focus (nice pun) towards composition and storytelling. The simplicity of carrying one camera encourages me to be more spontaneous. For the egret (or is it a heron?) photo above, I would have loved a big telephoto to zoom in… but I survived, and the resultant photo is thus composed with overall framing in mind when pressing the shutter, rather than looking at the bird directly.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

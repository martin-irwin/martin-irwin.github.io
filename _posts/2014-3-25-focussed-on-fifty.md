Our journey to _[Hamarikyu Gardens](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/hama-rikyu-onshi-teien),_ via _[Ginza](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog/a-glimpse-of-ginza),_ started much farther north in _Kudanshita__._ We walked around the Eastern-wing of the Emperor's Palace, past all of the tourists and joggers, looking for something different.

Of course, it didn't take long. We're in Tokyo after all. 

I have no idea. 

OK, enough with the weird dog photos. I've probably got enough for a "_Dogs of Japan_" photobook... now there's an idea!

Just to the southeast of the palace, is the fantastic statue of the 14th Century samurai; [_Kusunoki Masashige_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusunoki_Masashige).

The statue is really quite large.

I'll end this mini-series here. The majority of shots were taken at a focal length of ~50mm, which is actually rather new for me. It's a favourite focal length amongst photographers, but the switch from 35mm is taking more adjustment than when I use ~85mm lenses. I suppose because it's somewhere in between _wide_ and _tight_. It's not really wide at all, unlike 35mm. And it's not super-tight, so one has to work hard for the details. Composition is a challenge, but this is exactly what I want from my photography; **inspirational subjects**, and **challenges**.

And that's just as well - I have a few "fast 50s" to put through their paces in the coming weeks.

_Coffee │_ __NEX-7 & _Canon FDn 50mm F1.4_ │ 50mm, 1/200, _ISO 100, f/4, Lightroom 4.2___ I don't think a day goes by without caffeine entering my bloodstream. In fact, my blood is probably about 85% espresso. I love the stuff. Latte, blend, black, Café _au lait_... if it contains coffee beans, then it probably has my attention.

I've never been a tea drinker, though the stereotype of the British is certainly that of a nation of tea drinkers. However, fellow (though fictitious) countryman James Bond, described tea as "_that flat, soft, time-wasting opium of the masses",_ and I am inclined to agree. A good strong coffee has character, taste, and purpose. I find tea to be somewhat bland (though perhaps I just make bad tea), though fruit tea and green teas are much more palatable.

My obsession with coffee started during my Ph.D - and understandably peaked during the writing of my doctoral thesis. It's a trend I've continued with, and I usually only feel that a morning has really started (i.e. my brain has engaged) after a good cup or two, of hot, strong, **coffee**.

Fancy a brew?

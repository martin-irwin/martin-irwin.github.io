A very busy week, overall better than the last, so things are on the up! Weather was miserable, except for the weekend. In fact, the weather is so nice right now that I’m rushing getting this posted so I can relax on the balcony in the sun.

These trees outside the apartment remind me of trees in Japan, so I love seeing them all year. They’re a brilliant green with the right light on them, too.

I hope you have a good week next week.

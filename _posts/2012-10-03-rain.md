_When it rains... │ NEX-7 & _Voigtländer Nokton Classic 35mm F1.4_ │ 35mm, _ISO 1250, f/2, 1/60, -2.7EV__

... it pours. I'm rather pleased to be inside writing this post, snugly tucked up away from the \[relative\] cold and wet outside. Though there's something satisfying about coming inside after being out in the rain, tonight I rather feel more satisfied simply watching and hearing it fall.

I researched cloud formation and processes during my Ph.D in atmospheric physics, but on nights like this I prefer to ignore the science behind it all and watch the rain bounce of roof-tops, umbrellas and trees. I like to hear the near-deafening roar of a downpour. I like to see the mini-rivers form wherever they can. An in Japan, I like to see people riding a bicycle one-handed whilst wielding an umbrella :)

This striking red building really stood out down the backstreets of Bunkyo, as I walked to meet Charlotte in Akihabara (_click the photo for fullscreen_). If it weren't for the メヂィアミクス研究所 laminated sign above the postbox, one may not expect this photo to have been taken in Japan. Incidentally, メヂィアミクス研究所 reads as "media mix laboratory" which is the name of [this](http://www.mmlab.co.jp) cute little company. When framing this shot, I didn't really care what this building was, I just wanted the photo. Now I can't help but wonder what's inside, _behind closed doors_.

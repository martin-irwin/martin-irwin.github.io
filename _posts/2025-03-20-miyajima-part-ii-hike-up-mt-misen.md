title: Miyajima Part II – hike up Mt. Misen
excerpt: Scaling Mount Misen via the Daisho-in Route was an adventure—3km, 2,000 stone steps, and a race against the setting sun. Dressed more for a city stroll than a hike, we navigated slippery stone steps and clinging trousers, earning a laugh and a compliment from fellow hikers. Along the way, we met a curious Ryukyu Land Crab before reaching the summit just in time for a breathtaking sunset. The descent in darkness, guided by iPhone torches, capped off an unforgettable climb before our journey continued westward through Hiroshima, Fukuoka, and Nagasaki.

We hiked up Mt. Misen (弥山), which stands at 535m above sea level, scaling mountain via the Daisho-in Route, which is around 3km and has over 2,000 stone steps. Those wishing to go this route should prepare around 2 hours for the hike. We started the climb with sunset on our minds, and fortunately made it in time.

We were more dressed for a nice day out, and thus were not exactly wearing clothes associated with being on holiday, let alone hiking. One British couple of the way down exclaimed “we must be the best dressed couple of the mountain”. Nice compliment that it was, my trousers kept catching on my knee due to perspiration, and the smooth leather sole of the shoes on the 2,000 stone steps made it feel like I was ice-skating uphill. However, we made it in the end, and no-one died.

Along the way, we made a new friend—a little Ryukyu Land Crab. 

The sunset was spectacular. Naturally, the photo does not do it justice. I took the photo more for the memory, than for taking a great photo, but that’s what the blog is about. Sharing memories and photos along the way.

Hiking down in the darkness was interesting, with iPhones for torches. We headed back to Hiroshima centre to the hotel, from where we had a day to see the museum and Hiroshima city a little, before continuing West, through Fukuoka to Nagasaki.

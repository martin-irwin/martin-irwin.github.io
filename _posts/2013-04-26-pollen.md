These lilies really are getting a lot of airtime! They've been [going strong](/martin-irwin-photography/2013/04/23/last-one "Last One") for over [two weeks](/martin-irwin-photography/2013/04/23/last-one "Last One") now, and thrived during [our trip to Hiroshima](/martin-irwin-photography/2013/04/22/atomic-bomb-dome-hiroshima-pt-1 "Atomic Bomb Dome [Hiroshima Pt. 1]"). There are only two flowers remaining now, as we prune off the stragglers. Anyway, the above-shot is a montage of 1 capture. On the left, the original image, slightly cropped at the sides. The black square denotes the area taken of the right image, which is a 100%, i.e. sensor-level (1:1), crop. I'm quite amazed! The pollen looks like little grains of brown rice, or 玄米 _genmai_, in Japanese.

I really wasn't expecting to get this level of detail, but I am seriously impressed! Luckily, we don't suffer from hayfever, so we are instead just treated to the welcoming fresh scent of these lilies each time we walk through the door.

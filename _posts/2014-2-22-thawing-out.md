It's the first Saturday in weeks that we've not been submerged in snow. No blizzard today, just very clear skies. In fact, the huge mounds of snow dotted around the streets now appear out of place.

The strong, late-afternoon light casts fantastic shadows, but with high-rise buildings in abundance, it can be somewhat short-lived.

The sky was a brilliant blue all-day long.

I've made a slight change to the way in which my "subscribe" emails are handled. Subscribers will now be greeted with an email containing the thumbnail picture (i.e. the picture that links to this post via the [blog](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/myblog) link), and the post will contain an excerpt (hopefully encouraging recipients to pay my site a visit). You can subscribe to the mailing list at the bottom of my [contact page](http://www.martinirwinphotography.com/contact/).

The gap in the fence was just large enough to squeeze the lens through! I liked the obvious ageing in this scene, from the rusty pipe to the obviously draughty windows. The curtains look like something from 1980, and probably are.

I also liked the difference grid sizes offered by the shadow of the fence across the objects near and far.

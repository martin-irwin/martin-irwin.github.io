I went for a little stroll at lunchtime; in the winter months it's tempting to stay inside and not expose oneself to the elements. This would work, if Japanese buildings had any kind of insulation whatsoever. Unless heaters are blazing all day (and even if they are), the rooms will lose heat quicker than you can say "_Jack Frost_".

This means that it can actually be warmer outside, in the direct sun, than inside. Nuts. Of course, the opposite is true in the summer - it's impossible to cool down.

 After stretching my legs, it was time to get back to the office and get back to work.

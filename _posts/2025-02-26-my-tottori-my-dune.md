We were now just 300 km from Hiroshima City, at the Tottori Sand Dunes. Among Japan's prefectural capitals, Tottori has one of the lowest populations—having seen only a 20% increase after WWII. The population has remained remarkably stable over the past century.

The visit was fascinating, and I'm glad we made the detour. Though there were other tourists around, everyone was considerate, making space so others could capture their perfect photos.

The dunes themselves are impressive in scale. During our visit, I picked up some locally roasted beans from a charming roadside shop, ~[Weekday Coffee Roasters](https://wcr2018.stores.jp/)~.

I haven't tried the coffee yet, but I'm confident it will be delicious.

If you're in the area, I'd recommend stopping by Tottori. While the region's main attraction is its magnificent sand dunes, that's precisely what makes it special—it's refreshingly different from typical tourist destinations.

From there, we drove to Hiroshima to return our rental car (dropping it off at 8 PM after covering 1,000 km). We checked into our hotel, planning to spend a few days exploring before continuing our journey south...

I took this photo in October, 2011. Recently going through my archives, it jumped out of the dark at me. I've thrown it onto the homepage of my site, which was just populated with more recent photos. However, this image is from a time long-before this site. It's from a time where we had only been in Japan 10 months, and were thinking for maybe just 2 more.  

Here we are, over two years on.

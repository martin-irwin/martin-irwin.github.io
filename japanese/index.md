Every morning, I learn new Kanji. I have a goal to hit the 2136 常用漢字　「jōyō kanji」by the time I am next in Japan. My method is simple; to learn new kanji meanings and write them down as I go. I do this on a grid known as 原稿用紙 (genkō yōshi), and using the texbook commonly referred to as the KKLC (Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course). 

Here's an example of the writing of new kanji:

I do this on an e-ink tablet which has great battery life and is easier on the eyes than using an iPad. Originally, I thought I would be using the iPad for this task, but the e-ink is really great. It's also fun to write kanji down on pieces of paper, which I do sometimes to spice things up.

# Kanji progress 
(updated 03/06/25)

Total target: 2146  
Learned so far: 1020  
Remaining: **1126**

I created this archive to track my progress. Click on a link, and you'll see the kanji I knew by that date, coloured by how well I know them. Click the kanji to go to a dictionary and see its meaning. 

Wish me luck!

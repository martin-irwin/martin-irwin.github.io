I really had no idea what to call this image\*. I suppose that's not really important. "An image is worth a thousand words", after all. I've also heard that a good photograph never needs a title, or explanation. If it does, it's no good. I'm not sure I agree with that notion... especially for abstract art, sculpture...

This thing was churning out a colossal amount of water, and was lit up rather brilliantly.

It was part of a larger restaurant complex not far from Tokyo station, and the Imperial Palace.

You can see just how large these buildings are - in the bottom right you'll see Charlotte for scale (she's a towering 5ft tall).

I noticed a huge crack in one of the large, old walls behind the restaurant building, and my guess is that this crack appeared around 2 years ago, during the great earthquake in 2011.

Quite a crack. I could have put my hand in there. It's good to be reminded that earthquakes can happen at any time, without any notice (I'll go into this another time). Humbling, yet encouraging. Make the most of now.

\*EDIT (20/2): Well, I've finally remembered what I should have called this photo: [Nautilus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus).

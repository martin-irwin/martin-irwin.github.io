When I left the house this morning, I saw enormous storm clouds over central Tokyo and heard the rumblings of thunder. I knew rain was forecast for later in the day, but thought I'd be safe until tonight. When I emerged out of the underground network closer to work (in the centre of Tokyo), it was as if the city had been through a car wash. It must have been 100% humidity, even at 32â„ƒ. The ground was soaked, and the trees were looking greener than ever.

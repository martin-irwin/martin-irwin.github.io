I finally \[lightly\] dusted off the bike, which has been essentially abandoned since November. I re-installed the fully charged battery, which has been kept dry and warm inside all winter, checked the tyre pressures, and went on a light tour.

It was really nice to be out on the bike again, but at speed, the Spring air is a bit chilly. I am looking forward to the season ahead, however.

I thought I’d share a few more snaps—not many readers themselves live in Germany, so here’s a few photos showing both the visible old parts (churches, mainly), mountains of the black forest, and new apartment buildings.

The DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) German-speaking areas all have these metal shutters, from what I can gather. Curtains are less popular/commonplace than in France or the UK, where a room is considered unf\[ur/i\]nished if there’s no curtain.

One thing I really dislike, is the function-only approach to decor, such as the blinds, and railings. It all looks like soviet-era/council housing with zero consideration given to what is nice to look at, but on the upside, things tend to have a good function and the buildings are at least well insulated, which is more than can be said for most homes in the UK.

Happy Easter.

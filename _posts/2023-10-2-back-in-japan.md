It feels like this post has been 6 years in the making—that was the last time I was in Japan. Shame on me. And on COVID19, of course.

How was it to be back? Fantastic. Hardly anything has changed in the last 10 years, which is great. I do notice many small changes, though. Lots more tourists now, though we visited tourist places. When I lived in Japan, no-one was using iPhones… now they have 65% market share.

We went to many places I’ve known over the years, but then many places I’ve never visited. You know how it is—when you live somewhere you tend to not visit the touristic places as much, unless a friend or family member is visiting or there’s some other special occasion.

I treated myself to a new lens, towards the end of the trip. Until then, most photos are at either 28mm, 35mm, or 55mm. I am sure you can tell which!

Until the next post.

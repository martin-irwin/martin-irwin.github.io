Though my destination is usually the same each night (same train line, same final stop), I try to walk through different backstreets to increase my chances for inspiration.

Sometimes, I see something "new" in an object or building I've seen hundreds of times. Other times, random situations present themselves.

If I am not in the mood or the weather isn't favourable, I won't bother even taking my camera out of my bag. Sometimes I walk the entire distance with my camera in hand, _looking_ for things, but not _seeing_ them.

I think my message, if there is one, would be to not force yourself to take photos, or capture a moment. Some moments are better described verbally, and others visually. Whatever happens, keep the picture taking as a fun activity.

Happy snapping :)

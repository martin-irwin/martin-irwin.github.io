Eighteen years after my first trip to Japan, this marks my first time on the island of Hokkaido in the north. The area is a winter tourist spot due to the excellent snow and skiing, but we’re here to escape the heat further south. That’s written tongue-in-cheek/very relative as it’s 34ºC right now.

I did bring my Sony RX1 but forgot the SD card - these photos are all iPhone 15 Pro. I bought an SD card last night though, so the rest of the trip I’ll be posting a mix.

We took the _Gran Class_ bullet train to Hokkaido which was fantastic. The E5 may now be my favourite bullet train… it was my first time on this model though I’ve known it for years.

Thanks for reading!

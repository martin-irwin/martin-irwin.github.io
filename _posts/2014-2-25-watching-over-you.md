I shared the photo below with a friend back in the UK tonight, who commented "how is it even remotely legal to have such a heavily tinted rear screen?

This car is an _itasha_ (痛車) literally a _painful car._ It was as loud aurally as it was visually, so a headache wouldn't be out of the question. I answered that transit vans don't have visible rear screens, so I suppose it's not mandatory? However, one has to remember this is Japan. Just look at that registration plate!

Here in Tokyo, the _filth_ as they're sometimes called in the UK, ([see entry 1.4](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/filth)) don't waste their time fining people for having LEDs all around their car... they're too busy using their megaphones to say "危ないよ！" (it's dangerous) to people crossing the road in a freestyle manner.

I walk this route almost every night, but the above scenes are now commonplace. If time allows, I do tend to fire off a few shots of the more interesting things, take my time, and begin to **look** again. I won't be here forever, so it's worth taking the time to appreciate (in any form) our surroundings, even if we see them day-in, day-out. I suppose the "take-home message" I want to leave from this blog entry is to take the time to notice things. Notice the way the light hits objects, the shadows, the colours.

Don't exist - _live_.
